times
--- get process and waited-for child process times
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/times.h">sys/times.h</A>&gt;

clock_t times(struct tms *<I>buffer</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>times</I>()
function shall fill the
<B>tms</B>

structure pointed to by
<I>buffer</I>

with time-accounting information. The
<B>tms</B>

structure is defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/times.h">sys/times.h</A>&gt;</I>.

<P>

All times are measured in terms of the number of clock ticks used.
<P>

The times of a terminated child process shall be included in the
<I>tms_cutime</I>

and
<I>tms_cstime</I>

elements of the parent when
<I>wait</I>(),
<I>waitid</I>(),
or
<I>waitpid</I>()
returns the process ID of this terminated child. If a child process
has not waited for its children, their times shall not be included in
its times.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
The
<I>tms_utime</I>

structure member is the CPU time charged for the execution of user
instructions of the calling process.
<DT> *<DD>
The
<I>tms_stime</I>

structure member is the CPU time charged for execution by the system on
behalf of the calling process.
<DT> *<DD>
The
<I>tms_cutime</I>

structure member is the sum of the
<I>tms_utime</I>

and
<I>tms_cutime</I>

times of the child processes.
<DT> *<DD>
The
<I>tms_cstime</I>

structure member is the sum of the
<I>tms_stime</I>

and
<I>tms_cstime</I>

times of the child processes.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion,
<I>times</I>()
shall return the elapsed real time, in clock ticks, since an arbitrary
point in the past (for example, system start-up time). This point does
not change from one invocation of
<I>times</I>()
within the process to another. The return value may overflow the
possible range of type
<B>clock_t</B>.

If
<I>times</I>()
fails, (<B>clock_t</B>)-1 shall be returned and
<I>errno</I>

set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

No errors are defined.
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Timing a Database Lookup</H3>

<P>

The following example defines two functions,
<I>start_clock</I>()
and
<I>end_clock</I>(),
that are used to time a lookup. It also defines variables of type
<B>clock_t</B>

and
<B>tms</B>

to measure the duration of transactions. The
<I>start_clock</I>()
function saves the beginning times given by the
<I>times</I>()
function. The
<I>end_clock</I>()
function gets the ending times and prints the difference between the
two times.

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

Applications should use <I>sysconf</I>(_SC_CLK_TCK)
to determine the number of clock ticks per second as it may vary from
system to system.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

The accuracy of the times reported is intentionally left unspecified to
allow implementations flexibility in design, from uniprocessor to
multi-processor networks.
<P>

The inclusion of times of child processes is recursive, so that a
parent process may collect the total times of all of its descendants.
But the times of a child are only added to those of its parent when its
parent successfully waits on the child. Thus, it is not guaranteed
that a parent process can always see the total times of all its
descendants; see also the discussion of the term ``realtime'' in
<I>alarm</I>().

<P>

If the type
<B>clock_t</B>

is defined to be a signed 32-bit integer, it overflows in somewhat more
than a year if there are 60 clock ticks per second,
or less than a year if there are 100. There are individual systems
that run continuously for longer than that. This volume of POSIX.1-2008 permits an
implementation to make the reference point for the returned value be
the start-up time of the process, rather than system start-up time.
<P>

The term ``charge'' in this context has nothing to do with billing
for services. The operating system accounts for time used in this
way. That information must be correct, regardless of how that
information is used.
