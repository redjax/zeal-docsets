<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/socket.h">sys/socket.h</A>&gt;

int bind(int <I>socket</I>, const struct sockaddr *<I>address</I>,
    socklen_t <I>address_len</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>bind</I>()
function shall assign a local socket address
<I>address</I>

to a socket identified by descriptor
<I>socket</I>

that has no local socket address assigned. Sockets created with the
<I>socket</I>()
function are initially unnamed; they are identified only by their
address family.
<P>

The
<I>bind</I>()
function takes the following arguments:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>socket</I><DD>
Specifies the file descriptor of the socket to be bound.
<DT><I>address</I><DD>
Points to a
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure containing the address to be bound to the socket. The length
and format of the address depend on the address family of the socket.
<DT><I>address_len</I><DD>
Specifies the length of the
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure pointed to by the
<I>address</I>

argument.
</DL>
<P>

The socket specified by
<I>socket</I>

may require the process to have appropriate privileges to use the
<I>bind</I>()
function.
<P>

If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX and the pathname in
<I>address</I>

names a symbolic link,
<I>bind</I>()
shall fail and set
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>[EADDRINUSE]</B>.

<P>

If the socket address cannot be assigned immediately and O_NONBLOCK is
set for the file descriptor for the socket,
<I>bind</I>()
shall fail and set
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>[EINPROGRESS]</B>,

but the assignment request shall not be aborted, and the assignment
shall be completed asynchronously. Subsequent calls to
<I>bind</I>()
for the same socket, before the assignment is completed, shall fail
and set
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>[EALREADY]</B>.

<P>

When the assignment has been performed asynchronously,
<I>pselect</I>(),
<I>select</I>(),
and
<I>poll</I>()
shall indicate that the file descriptor for the socket is ready for
reading and writing.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion,
<I>bind</I>()
shall return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and
<I>errno</I>

set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>bind</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EADDRINUSE</B>

<DD>
The specified address is already in use.
<DT><B>EADDRNOTAVAIL</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The specified address is not available from the local machine.
<DT><B>EAFNOSUPPORT</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The specified address is not a valid address for the address family of
the specified socket.
<DT><B>EALREADY</B>

<DD>
An assignment request is already in progress for the specified socket.
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The
<I>socket</I>

argument is not a valid file descriptor.
<DT><B>EINPROGRESS</B>

<DD>
O_NONBLOCK is set for the file descriptor for the socket and the
assignment cannot be immediately performed; the assignment shall be
performed asynchronously.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The socket is already bound to an address, and the protocol does not
support binding to a new address; or the socket has been shut down.
<DT><B>ENOBUFS</B>

<DD>
Insufficient resources were available to complete the call.
<DT><B>ENOTSOCK</B>

<DD>
The
<I>socket</I>

argument does not refer to a socket.
<DT><B>EOPNOTSUPP</B>

<DD>
The socket type of the specified socket does not support binding to an
address.
</DL>
<P>

If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then
<I>bind</I>()
shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix denies search permission, or the
requested name requires writing in a directory with a mode that denies
write permission.
<DT><B>EDESTADDRREQ</B> or <B>EISDIR</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The
<I>address</I>

argument is a null pointer.
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurred.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the
pathname in
<I>address</I>.

<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix of the pathname in
<I>address</I>

does not name an existing file or the pathname is an empty string.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B> or <B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The pathname in
<I>address</I>

contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
character and ends with one or more trailing
&lt;slash&gt;
characters. If the pathname names an existing file, an
<B>[ENOENT]</B>

error shall not occur.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix of the pathname in
<I>address</I>

names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link
to a directory, or the pathname in
<I>address</I>

contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
character and ends with one or more trailing
&lt;slash&gt;
characters and the last pathname component names an existing file
that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.
<DT><B>EROFS</B>

<DD>
The name would reside on a read-only file system.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>bind</I>()
function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
The specified address is protected and the current user does not have
permission to bind to it.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The
<I>address_len</I>

argument is not a valid length for the address family.
<DT><B>EISCONN</B>

<DD>
The socket is already connected.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
More than
{SYMLOOP_MAX}
symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the pathname in
<I>address</I>.

<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The length of a pathname exceeds
{PATH_MAX},
or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
result with a length that exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.
