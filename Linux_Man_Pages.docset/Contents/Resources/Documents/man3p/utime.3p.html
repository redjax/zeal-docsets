<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/utime.h">utime.h</A>&gt;

int utime(const char *<I>path</I>, const struct utimbuf *<I>times</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>utime</I>()
function shall set the access and modification times of the file named
by the
<I>path</I>

argument.
<P>

If
<I>times</I>

is a null pointer, the access and modification times of the file shall
be set to the current time. The effective user ID of the process shall
match the owner of the file, or the process has write permission to the
file or has appropriate privileges, to use
<I>utime</I>()
in this manner.
<P>

If
<I>times</I>

is not a null pointer,
<I>times</I>

shall be interpreted as a pointer to a
<B>utimbuf</B>

structure and the access and modification times shall be set to the
values contained in the designated structure. Only a process with
the effective user ID equal to the user ID of the file or a process with
appropriate privileges may use
<I>utime</I>()
this way.
<P>

The
<B>utimbuf</B>

structure is defined in the
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/utime.h">utime.h</A>&gt;</I>

header. The times in the structure
<B>utimbuf</B>

are measured in seconds since the Epoch.
<P>

Upon successful completion, the
<I>utime</I>()
function shall mark the last file status change timestamp
for update; see
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/stat.h">sys/stat.h</A>&gt;</I>.

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
shall be returned and
<I>errno</I>

shall be set to indicate the error, and the file times shall not be
affected.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>utime</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
Search permission is denied by a component of the path prefix; or the
<I>times</I>

argument is a null pointer and the effective user ID of the process
does not match the owner of the file, the process does not have write
permission for the file, and the process does not have appropriate
privileges.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the
<I>path</I>

argument.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
A component of
<I>path</I>

does not name an existing file or
<I>path</I>

is an empty string.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither
a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory, or the
<I>path</I>

argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
character and ends with one or more trailing
&lt;slash&gt;
characters and the last pathname component names an existing file
that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The
<I>times</I>

argument is not a null pointer and the effective user ID of the calling
process does not match the owner of the file and the calling process
does not have appropriate privileges.
<DT><B>EROFS</B>

<DD>
The file system containing the file is read-only.
<BR>

</DL>
<P>

The
<I>utime</I>()
function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
More than
{SYMLOOP_MAX}
symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the
<I>path</I>

argument.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The length of a pathname exceeds
{PATH_MAX},
or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
result with a length that exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.

<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

Since the
<B>utimbuf</B>

structure only contains
<B>time_t</B>

variables and is not accurate to fractions of a second,
applications should use the
<I>utimensat</I>()
function instead of the obsolescent
<I>utime</I>()
function.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

The
<I>actime</I>

structure member must be present so that an application may set it,
even though an implementation may ignore it and not change the last data
access timestamp on the file. If an application intends to leave one of
the times of a file unchanged while changing the other, it should use
<I>stat</I>()
or
<I>fstat</I>()
to retrieve the file's
<I>st_atim</I>

and
<I>st_mtim</I>

parameters, set
<I>actime</I>

and
<I>modtime</I>

in the buffer, and change one of them before making the
<I>utime</I>()
call.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</H2>

The
<I>utime</I>()
function may be removed in a future version.
