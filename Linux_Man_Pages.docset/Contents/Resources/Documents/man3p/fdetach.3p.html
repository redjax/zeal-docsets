fdetach
--- detach a name from a STREAMS-based file descriptor (<B>STREAMS</B>)
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stropts.h">stropts.h</A>&gt;

int fdetach(const char *<I>path</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>fdetach</I>()
function shall detach a STREAMS-based file from the file to which
it was attached by a previous call to
<I>fattach</I>().
The
<I>path</I>

argument points to the pathname of the attached STREAMS file. The
process shall have appropriate privileges or be the owner of the file.
A successful call to
<I>fdetach</I>()
shall cause all pathnames that named the attached STREAMS file to again
name the file to which the STREAMS file was attached. All subsequent
operations on
<I>path</I>

shall operate on the underlying file and not on the STREAMS file.
<P>

All open file descriptions established while the STREAMS file was
attached to the file referenced by
<I>path</I>

shall still refer to the STREAMS file after the
<I>fdetach</I>()
has taken effect.
<P>

If there are no open file descriptors or other references to the
STREAMS file, then a successful call to
<I>fdetach</I>()
shall be equivalent to performing the last
<I>close</I>()
on the attached file.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion,
<I>fdetach</I>()
shall return 0; otherwise, it shall return -1 and set
<I>errno</I>

to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>fdetach</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The
<I>path</I>

argument names a file that is not currently attached.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the
<I>path</I>

argument.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
A component of
<I>path</I>

does not name an existing file or
<I>path</I>

is an empty string.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither
a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory, or the
<I>path</I>

argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
character and ends with one or more trailing
&lt;slash&gt;
characters and the last pathname component names an existing file
that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The effective user ID is not the owner of
<I>path</I>

and the process does not have appropriate privileges.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>fdetach</I>()
function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
More than
{SYMLOOP_MAX}
symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the
<I>path</I>

argument.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The length of a pathname exceeds
{PATH_MAX},
or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
result with a length that exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.

<H3>Detaching a File</H3>

<P>

The following example detaches the STREAMS-based file
<B>/tmp/named-STREAM</B>

from the file to which it was attached by a previous, successful call
to
<I>fattach</I>().
Subsequent calls to open this file refer to the underlying file, not to
the STREAMS file.
