setregid
--- set real and effective group IDs
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;

int setregid(gid_t <I>rgid</I>, gid_t <I>egid</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>setregid</I>()
function shall set the real and effective group IDs of the calling
process.
<P>

If
<I>rgid</I>

is -1, the real group ID shall not be changed; if
<I>egid</I>

is -1, the effective group ID shall not be changed.
<P>

The real and effective group IDs may be set to different values in the
same call.
<P>

Only a process with appropriate privileges can set the real group ID
and the effective group ID to any valid value.
<P>

A non-privileged process can set either the real group ID to the saved
set-group-ID from one of the
<I>exec</I>

family of functions, or the effective group ID to the saved
set-group-ID or the real group ID.
<P>

If the real group ID is being set (<I>rgid</I>

is not -1), or the effective group ID is being set to a value not
equal to the real group ID, then the saved set-group-ID of the current
process shall be set equal to the new effective group ID.
<P>

Any supplementary group IDs of the calling process remain unchanged.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
shall be returned and
<I>errno</I>

set to indicate the error, and neither of the group IDs are changed.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>setregid</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value of the
<I>rgid</I>

or
<I>egid</I>

argument is invalid or out-of-range.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The process does not have appropriate privileges and a change other
than changing the real group ID to the saved set-group-ID, or changing
the effective group ID to the real group ID or the saved set-group-ID,
was requested.

<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

If a non-privileged set-group-ID process sets its effective group ID to
its real group ID, it can only set its effective group ID back to the
previous value if
<I>rgid</I>

was -1 in the
<I>setregid</I>()
call, since the saved-group-ID is not changed in that case. If
<I>rgid</I>

was equal to the real group ID in the
<I>setregid</I>()
call, then the saved set-group-ID will also have been changed to the
real user ID.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

Earlier versions of this standard did not specify whether the saved
set-group-ID was affected by
<I>setregid</I>()
calls. This version specifies common existing practice that constitutes an
important security feature. The ability to set both the effective group
ID and saved set-group-ID to be the same as the real group ID means that
any security weakness in code that is executed after that point cannot
result in malicious code being executed with the previous effective
group ID. Privileged applications could already do this using just
<I>setgid</I>(),
but for non-privileged applications the only standard method available
is to use this feature of
<I>setregid</I>().
