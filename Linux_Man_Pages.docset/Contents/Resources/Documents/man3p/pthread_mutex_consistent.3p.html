pthread_mutex_consistent ---
mark state protected by robust mutex as consistent
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</A>&gt;

int pthread_mutex_consistent(pthread_mutex_t *<I>mutex</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

If
<I>mutex</I>

is a robust mutex in an inconsistent state, the
<I>pthread_mutex_consistent</I>()
function can be used to mark the state protected by the mutex
referenced by
<I>mutex</I>

as consistent again.
<P>

If an owner of a robust mutex terminates while holding the mutex, the
mutex becomes inconsistent and the next thread that acquires the mutex
lock shall be notified of the state by the return value
<B>[EOWNERDEAD]</B>.

In this case, the mutex does not become normally usable again until the
state is marked consistent.
<P>

If the thread which acquired the mutex lock with the return value
<B>[EOWNERDEAD]</B>

terminates before calling either
<I>pthread_mutex_consistent</I>()
or
<I>pthread_mutex_unlock</I>(),
the next thread that acquires the mutex lock shall be notified about
the state of the mutex by the return value
<B>[EOWNERDEAD]</B>.

<P>

The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the
<I>mutex</I>

argument to
<I>pthread_mutex_consistent</I>()
does not refer to an initialized mutex.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion, the
<I>pthread_mutex_consistent</I>()
function shall return zero. Otherwise, an error value shall be returned
to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>pthread_mutex_consistent</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The mutex object referenced by
<I>mutex</I>

is not robust or does not protect an inconsistent state.
</DL>
<P>

These functions shall not return an error code of
<B>[EINTR]</B>.

<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

The
<I>pthread_mutex_consistent</I>()
function is only responsible for notifying the implementation that the
state protected by the mutex has been recovered and that normal
operations with the mutex can be resumed. It is the responsibility of
the application to recover the state so it can be reused. If the
application is not able to perform the recovery, it can notify the
implementation that the situation is unrecoverable by a call to
<I>pthread_mutex_unlock</I>()
without a prior call to
<I>pthread_mutex_consistent</I>(),
in which case subsequent threads that attempt to lock the mutex will
fail to acquire the lock and be returned
<B>[ENOTRECOVERABLE]</B>.

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
<I>mutex</I>

argument to
<I>pthread_mutex_consistent</I>()
does not refer to an initialized mutex, it is recommended that the
function should fail and report an
<B>[EINVAL]</B>

error.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</H2>
