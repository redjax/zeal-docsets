<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO&nbsp;C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO&nbsp;C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1-2008 defers to the ISO&nbsp;C standard.
<P>

These functions shall convert the initial portion of the wide-character
string pointed to by
<I>nptr</I>

to
<B>long</B>

and
<B>long long</B>,

respectively. First, they shall decompose the input string into three
parts:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
An initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space wide-character
codes (as specified by
<I>iswspace</I>())
<DT> 2.<DD>
A subject sequence interpreted as an integer represented in some radix
determined by the value of
<I>base</I>

<DT> 3.<DD>
A final wide-character string of one or more unrecognized
wide-character codes, including the terminating null wide-character
code of the input wide-character string
</DL>
<P>

Then they shall attempt to convert the subject sequence to an
integer, and return the result.
<P>

If
<I>base</I>

is 0, the expected form of the subject sequence is that of a decimal
constant, octal constant, or hexadecimal constant, any of which may be
preceded by a
<B>'+'</B>

or
<B>'-'</B>

sign. A decimal constant begins with a non-zero digit, and consists of
a sequence of decimal digits. An octal constant consists of the prefix
<B>'0'</B>

optionally followed by a sequence of the digits
<B>'0'</B>

to
<B>'7'</B>

only. A hexadecimal constant consists of the prefix 0x or 0X followed
by a sequence of the decimal digits and letters
<B>'a'</B>

(or
<B>'A'</B>)

to
<B>'f'</B>

(or
<B>'F'</B>)

with values 10 to 15 respectively.
<P>

If the value of
<I>base</I>

is between 2 and 36, the expected form of the subject sequence is a
sequence of letters and digits representing an integer with the radix
specified by
<I>base</I>,

optionally preceded by a
<B>'+'</B>

or
<B>'-'</B>

sign, but not including an integer suffix. The letters from
<B>'a'</B>

(or
<B>'A'</B>)

to
<B>'z'</B>

(or
<B>'Z'</B>)

inclusive are ascribed the values 10 to 35; only letters whose ascribed
values are less than that of
<I>base</I>

shall be permitted. If the value of
<I>base</I>

is 16, the wide-character code representations of 0x or 0X may
optionally precede the sequence of letters and digits, following the
sign if present.
<P>

The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of
the input wide-character string, starting with the first
non-white-space wide-character code that is of the expected form. The
subject sequence contains no wide-character codes if the input
wide-character string is empty or consists entirely of white-space
wide-character code, or if the first non-white-space wide-character
code is other than a sign or a permissible letter or digit.
<P>

If the subject sequence has the expected form and
<I>base</I>

is 0, the sequence of wide-character codes starting with the first
digit shall be interpreted as an integer constant. If the subject
sequence has the expected form and the value of
<I>base</I>

is between 2 and 36, it shall be used as the base for conversion,
ascribing to each letter its value as given above. If the subject
sequence begins with a minus-sign, the value resulting from the
conversion shall be negated. A pointer to the final wide-character
string shall be stored in the object pointed to by
<I>endptr</I>,

provided that
<I>endptr</I>

is not a null pointer.
<P>

In other than the C
or POSIX
locales, other implementation-defined subject sequences may be
accepted.
<P>

If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no
conversion shall be performed; the value of
<I>nptr</I>

shall be stored in the object pointed to by
<I>endptr</I>,

provided that
<I>endptr</I>

is not a null pointer.
<P>

These functions shall not change the setting of
<I>errno</I>

if successful.
<P>

Since 0,
{LONG_MIN}
or
{LLONG_MIN}
and
{LONG_MAX}
or
{LLONG_MAX}
are returned on error and are also valid returns on success, an
application wishing to check for error situations should set
<I>errno</I>

to 0, then call
<I>wcstol</I>()
or
<I>wcstoll</I>(),
then check
<I>errno</I>.

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the converted
value, if any. If no conversion could be performed, 0 shall be returned
and
<I>errno</I>

may be set to indicate the error.
If the correct value is outside the range of representable values,
{LONG_MIN},
{LONG_MAX},
{LLONG_MIN},
or
{LLONG_MAX}
shall be returned (according to the sign of the value), and
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>[ERANGE]</B>.

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

These functions shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value of
<I>base</I>

is not supported.
<DT><B>ERANGE</B>

<DD>
The value to be returned is not representable.
</DL>
<P>

These functions may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
No conversion could be performed.
