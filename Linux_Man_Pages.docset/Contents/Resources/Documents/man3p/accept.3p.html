accept
--- accept a new connection on a socket
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/socket.h">sys/socket.h</A>&gt;

int accept(int <I>socket</I>, struct sockaddr *restrict <I>address</I>,
    socklen_t *restrict <I>address_len</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>accept</I>()
function shall extract the first connection on the queue of pending
connections, create a new socket with the same socket type protocol
and address family as the specified socket, and allocate a new file
descriptor for that socket.
<P>

The
<I>accept</I>()
function takes the following arguments:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>socket</I><DD>
Specifies a socket that was created with
<I>socket</I>(),
has been bound to an address with
<I>bind</I>(),
and has issued a successful call to
<I>listen</I>().
<DT><I>address</I><DD>
Either a null pointer, or a pointer to a
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure where the address of the connecting socket shall be returned.
<DT><I>address_len</I><DD>
Either a null pointer, if
<I>address</I>

is a null pointer, or a pointer to a
<B>socklen_t</B>

object which on input specifies the length of the supplied
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure, and on output specifies the length of the stored address.
</DL>
<P>

If
<I>address</I>

is not a null pointer, the address of the peer for the accepted
connection shall be stored in the
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure pointed to by
<I>address</I>,

and the length of this address shall be stored in the object pointed to
by
<I>address_len</I>.

<P>

If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of the
supplied
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure, the stored address shall be truncated.
<P>

If the protocol permits connections by unbound clients, and the peer is
not bound, then the value stored in the object pointed to by
<I>address</I>

is unspecified.
<P>

If the listen queue is empty of connection requests and O_NONBLOCK is
not set on the file descriptor for the socket,
<I>accept</I>()
shall block until a connection is present. If the
<I>listen</I>()
queue is empty of connection requests and O_NONBLOCK is set on the file
descriptor for the socket,
<I>accept</I>()
shall fail and set
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>[EAGAIN]</B>

or
<B>[EWOULDBLOCK]</B>.

<P>

The accepted socket cannot itself accept more connections. The original
socket remains open and can accept more connections.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion,
<I>accept</I>()
shall return the non-negative file descriptor of the accepted socket.
Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and
<I>errno</I>

set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>accept</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B> or <B>EWOULDBLOCK</B>

<DD>
<BR>

O_NONBLOCK is set for the socket file descriptor and no connections are
present to be accepted.
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The
<I>socket</I>

argument is not a valid file descriptor.
<DT><B>ECONNABORTED</B>

<DD>
<BR>

A connection has been aborted.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
The
<I>accept</I>()
function was interrupted by a signal that was caught before a valid
connection arrived.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The
<I>socket</I>

is not accepting connections.
<DT><B>EMFILE</B>

<DD>
All file descriptors available to the process are currently open.
<DT><B>ENFILE</B>

<DD>
The maximum number of file descriptors in the system are already open.
<DT><B>ENOBUFS</B>

<DD>
No buffer space is available.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
There was insufficient memory available to complete the operation.
<DT><B>ENOTSOCK</B>

<DD>
The
<I>socket</I>

argument does not refer to a socket.
<DT><B>EOPNOTSUPP</B>

<DD>
The socket type of the specified socket does not support accepting
connections.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>accept</I>()
function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EPROTO</B>

<DD>
A protocol error has occurred;
for example, the STREAMS protocol stack has not been initialized.
