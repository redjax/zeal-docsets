chmod, fchmodat
--- change mode of a file relative to directory file descriptor
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/stat.h">sys/stat.h</A>&gt;

int chmod(const char *<I>path</I>, mode_t <I>mode</I>);
int fchmodat(int <I>fd</I>, const char *<I>path</I>, mode_t <I>mode</I>, int <I>flag</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>chmod</I>()
function shall change S_ISUID, S_ISGID,
S_ISVTX,
and the file permission bits of the file named by the pathname pointed
to by the
<I>path</I>

argument to the corresponding bits in the
<I>mode</I>

argument. The application shall ensure that the effective user ID
of the process matches the owner of the file or the process has
appropriate privileges in order to do this.
<P>

S_ISUID, S_ISGID,
S_ISVTX,
and the file permission bits
are described in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/stat.h">sys/stat.h</A>&gt;</I>.

<P>

If the calling process does not have appropriate privileges, and if the
group ID of the file does not match the effective group ID or one of
the supplementary group IDs and if the file is a regular file, bit
S_ISGID (set-group-ID on execution) in the file's mode shall be cleared
upon successful return from
<I>chmod</I>().
<P>

Additional implementation-defined restrictions may cause the S_ISUID
and S_ISGID bits in
<I>mode</I>

to be ignored.
<P>

Upon successful completion,
<I>chmod</I>()
shall mark for update the last file status change timestamp of the file.
<P>

The
<I>fchmodat</I>()
function shall be equivalent to the
<I>chmod</I>()
function except in the case where
<I>path</I>

specifies a relative path. In this case the file to be changed is
determined relative to the directory associated with the file
descriptor
<I>fd</I>

instead of the current working directory. If the file descriptor was
opened without O_SEARCH, the function shall check whether directory
searches are permitted using the current permissions of the directory
underlying the file descriptor. If the file descriptor was opened with
O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the check.
<P>

Values for
<I>flag</I>

are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from the following
list, defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/fcntl.h">fcntl.h</A>&gt;</I>:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW<DD>
<BR>

If
<I>path</I>

names a symbolic link, then the mode of the symbolic link is changed.
</DL>
<P>

If
<I>fchmodat</I>()
is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the
<I>fd</I>

parameter, the current working directory shall be used. If also
<I>flag</I>

is zero, the behavior shall be identical to a call to
<I>chmod</I>().
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0.
Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set
<I>errno</I>

to indicate the error. If -1 is returned, no change to the
file mode occurs.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>

status = stat(&quot;home/cnd/mod1&quot;, &amp;buffer;);
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

In order to ensure that the S_ISUID and S_ISGID
bits are set, an application requiring this should use
<I>stat</I>()
after a successful
<I>chmod</I>()
to verify this.
<P>

Any file descriptors currently open by any process on the file could
possibly become invalid if the mode of the file is changed to a value
which would deny access to that process. One situation where this could
occur is on a stateless file system. This behavior will not occur in a
conforming environment.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

This volume of POSIX.1-2008 specifies that the S_ISGID bit is cleared by
<I>chmod</I>()
on a regular file under certain conditions. This is specified on the
assumption that regular files may be executed, and the system should
prevent users from making executable
<I>setgid</I>()
files perform with privileges that the caller does not have. On
implementations that support execution of other file types, the S_ISGID
bit should be cleared for those file types under the same
circumstances.
<P>

Implementations that use the S_ISUID bit to indicate some other
function (for example, mandatory record locking) on non-executable
files need not clear this bit on writing. They should clear the bit
for executable files and any other cases where the bit grants special
powers to processes that change the file contents. Similar comments
apply to the S_ISGID bit.
<P>

The purpose of the
<I>fchmodat</I>()
function is to enable changing the mode of files in directories other
than the current working directory without exposure to race conditions.
Any part of the path of a file could be changed in parallel to a call
to
<I>chmod</I>(),
resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file descriptor for
the target directory and using the
<I>fchmodat</I>()
function it can be guaranteed that the changed file is located relative
to the desired directory. Some implementations might allow changing
the mode of symbolic links. This is not supported by the interfaces in
the POSIX specification. Systems with such support provide an
interface named
<I>lchmod</I>().

To support such implementations
<I>fchmodat</I>()
has a
<I>flag</I>

parameter.
