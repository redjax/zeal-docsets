<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>posix_trace_getnext_event</I>()
function shall report a recorded trace event either from an
active trace stream without log
or a pre-recorded trace stream identified by the
<I>trid</I>

argument.
The
<I>posix_trace_trygetnext_event</I>()
function shall report a recorded trace event from an active
trace stream without log identified by the
<I>trid</I>

argument.
<P>

The trace event information associated with the recorded trace event
shall be copied by the function into the structure pointed to by the
argument
<I>event</I>

and the data associated with the trace event shall be copied into the
buffer pointed to by the
<I>data</I>

argument.
<P>

The
<I>posix_trace_getnext_event</I>()
function shall block if the
<I>trid</I>

argument identifies an active trace stream and there is currently no
trace event ready to be retrieved. When returning, if a recorded trace
event was reported, the variable pointed to by the
<I>unavailable</I>

argument shall be set to zero. Otherwise, the variable pointed to by
the
<I>unavailable</I>

argument shall be set to a value different from zero.
<P>

The
<I>posix_trace_timedgetnext_event</I>()
function shall attempt to get another trace event from an active trace
stream without log, as in the
<I>posix_trace_getnext_event</I>()
function. However, if no trace event is available from the trace
stream, the implied wait shall be terminated when the timeout specified
by the argument
<I>abstime</I>

expires, and the function shall return the error
<B>[ETIMEDOUT]</B>.

<P>

The timeout shall expire when the absolute time specified by
<I>abstime</I>

passes, as measured by the clock upon which timeouts are based (that
is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds
<I>abstime</I>),

or if the absolute time specified by
<I>abstime</I>

has already passed at the time of the call.
<P>

The timeout shall be based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.
The resolution of the timeout shall be the resolution of the clock
on which it is based. The
<B>timespec</B>

data type is defined in the
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/time.h">time.h</A>&gt;</I>

header.
<P>

Under no circumstance shall the function fail with a timeout if a trace
event is immediately available from the trace stream. The validity of
the
<I>abstime</I>

argument need not be checked if a trace event is immediately available
from the trace stream.
<P>

The behavior of this function for a pre-recorded trace stream is
unspecified.
<P>

The
<I>posix_trace_trygetnext_event</I>()
function shall not block.
This function shall return an error if the
<I>trid</I>

argument identifies a pre-recorded trace stream.
If a recorded trace event was reported, the variable pointed to by the
<I>unavailable</I>

argument shall be set to zero. Otherwise, if no trace event was
reported, the variable pointed to by the
<I>unavailable</I>

argument shall be set to a value different from zero.
<P>

The argument
<I>num_bytes</I>

shall be the size of the buffer pointed to by the
<I>data</I>

argument. The argument
<I>data_len</I>

reports to the application the length in bytes of the data record just
transferred. If
<I>num_bytes</I>

is greater than or equal to the size of the data associated with the
trace event pointed to by the
<I>event</I>

argument, all the recorded data shall be transferred. In this case,
the
<I>truncation-status</I>

member of the trace event structure shall be either
POSIX_TRACE_NOT_TRUNCATED,
if the trace event data was recorded without truncation while tracing,
or POSIX_TRACE_TRUNCATED_RECORD,
if the trace event data was truncated when it was recorded. If the
<I>num_bytes</I>

argument is less than the length of recorded trace event data, the data
transferred shall be truncated to a length of
<I>num_bytes</I>,

the value stored in the variable pointed to by
<I>data_len</I>

shall be equal to
<I>num_bytes</I>,

and the
<I>truncation-status</I>

member of the
<I>event</I>

structure argument shall be set to POSIX_TRACE_TRUNCATED_READ
(see the
<B>posix_trace_event_info</B>

structure defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/trace.h">trace.h</A>&gt;</I>).

<P>

The report of a trace event shall be sequential starting from the
oldest recorded trace event. Trace events shall be reported in the
order in which they were generated, up to an implementation-defined
time resolution that causes the ordering of trace events occurring very
close to each other to be unknown. Once reported, a trace event cannot
be reported again from an active trace stream. Once a trace event is
reported from an active trace stream without log, the trace stream
shall make the resources associated with that trace event available to
record future generated trace events.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value of
zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error number.
<P>

If successful, these functions store:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
The recorded trace event in the object pointed to by
<I>event</I>

<DT> *<DD>
The trace event information associated with the recorded trace event in
the object pointed to by
<I>data</I>

<DT> *<DD>
The length of this trace event information in the object pointed to by
<I>data_len</I>

<DT> *<DD>
The value of zero in the object pointed to by
<I>unavailable</I>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

These functions shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The trace stream identifier argument
<I>trid</I>

is invalid.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>posix_trace_getnext_event</I>()
and
<I>posix_trace_timedgetnext_event</I>()
functions shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
The operation was interrupted by a signal, and so the call had no
effect.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>posix_trace_trygetnext_event</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The trace stream identifier argument
<I>trid</I>

does not correspond to an active trace stream.
<BR>

</DL>
<P>

The
<I>posix_trace_timedgetnext_event</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
There is no trace event immediately available from the trace stream,
and the
<I>timeout</I>

argument is invalid.
<DT><B>ETIMEDOUT</B>

<DD>
No trace event was available from the trace stream before the specified
timeout
<I>timeout</I>

expired.
