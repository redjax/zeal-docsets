waitid
--- wait for a child process to change state
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/wait.h">sys/wait.h</A>&gt;

int waitid(idtype_t <I>idtype</I>, id_t <I>id</I>, siginfo_t *<I>infop</I>, int <I>options</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>waitid</I>()
function shall suspend the calling thread until one child of the
process containing the calling thread changes state. It records the
current state of a child in the structure pointed to by
<I>infop</I>.

The fields of the structure pointed to by
<I>infop</I>

are filled in as described for the SIGCHLD signal in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/signal.h">signal.h</A>&gt;</I>.

If a child process changed state prior to the call to
<I>waitid</I>(),
<I>waitid</I>()
shall return immediately. If more than one thread is suspended in
<I>wait</I>(),
<I>waitid</I>(),
or
<I>waitpid</I>()
waiting for termination of the same process, exactly one thread shall
return the process status at the time of the target process termination.
<P>

The
<I>idtype</I>

and
<I>id</I>

arguments are used to specify which children
<I>waitid</I>()
waits for.
<P>

If
<I>idtype</I>

is P_PID,
<I>waitid</I>()
shall wait for the child with a process ID equal to
(<B>pid_t</B>)<I>id</I>.
<P>

If
<I>idtype</I>

is P_PGID,
<I>waitid</I>()
shall wait for any child with a process group ID equal to
(<B>pid_t</B>)<I>id</I>.
<P>

If
<I>idtype</I>

is P_ALL,
<I>waitid</I>()
shall wait for any children and
<I>id</I>

is ignored.
<P>

The
<I>options</I>

argument is used to specify which state changes
<I>waitid</I>()
shall wait for. It is formed by OR'ing together the following flags:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>WCONTINUED<DD>
Status shall be returned for any continued child process whose status
either has not been reported since it continued from a job control stop
or has been reported only by calls to
<I>waitid</I>()
with the WNOWAIT flag set.
<DT>WEXITED<DD>
Wait for processes that have exited.
<DT>WNOHANG<DD>
Do not hang if no status is available; return immediately.
<DT>WNOWAIT<DD>
Keep the process whose status is returned in
<I>infop</I>

in a waitable state. This shall not affect the state of the process; the
process may be waited for again after this call completes.
<DT>WSTOPPED<DD>
Status shall be returned for any child that has stopped upon receipt of
a signal, and whose status either has not been reported since it stopped
or has been reported only by calls to
<I>waitid</I>()
with the WNOWAIT flag set.
</DL>
<P>

Applications shall specify at least one of the flags WEXITED, WSTOPPED,
or WCONTINUED to be OR'ed in with the
<I>options</I>

argument.
<P>

The application shall ensure that the
<I>infop</I>

argument points to a
<B>siginfo_t</B>

structure. If
<I>waitid</I>()
returns because a child process was found that satisfied the conditions
indicated by the arguments
<I>idtype</I>

and
<I>options</I>,

then the structure pointed to by
<I>infop</I>

shall be filled in by the system with the status of the process; the
<I>si_signo</I>

member shall be set equal to SIGCHLD.
If
<I>waitid</I>()
returns because WNOHANG was specified and status is not available for
any process specified by
<I>idtype</I>

and
<I>id</I>,

then the
<I>si_signo</I>

and
<I>si_pid</I>

members of the structure pointed to by
<I>infop</I>

shall be set to zero and the values of other members of the structure
are unspecified.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

If WNOHANG was specified and status is not available for any process
specified by
<I>idtype</I>

and
<I>id</I>,

0 shall be returned. If
<I>waitid</I>()
returns due to the change of state of one of its children, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and
<I>errno</I>

set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>waitid</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ECHILD</B>

<DD>
The calling process has no existing unwaited-for child processes.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
The
<I>waitid</I>()
function was interrupted by a signal.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
An invalid value was specified for
<I>options</I>,

or
<I>idtype</I>

and
<I>id</I>

specify an invalid set of processes.
</DL>
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

Calls to
<I>waitid</I>()
with
<I>idtype</I>

equal to P_ALL will collect information about any child process. This
may result in interactions with other interfaces that may be waiting
for their own children (such as by use of
<I>system</I>()).
For this reason it is recommended that portable applications not use
<I>waitid</I>()
with idtype of P_ALL. See also APPLICATION USAGE for
<I>wait</I>().
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</H2>

None.
