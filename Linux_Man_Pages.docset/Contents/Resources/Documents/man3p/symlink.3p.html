symlink, symlinkat
--- make a symbolic link relative to directory file descriptor
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;

int symlink(const char *<I>path1</I>, const char *<I>path2</I>);
int symlinkat(const char *<I>path1</I>, int <I>fd</I>, const char *<I>path2</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>symlink</I>()
function shall create a symbolic link called
<I>path2</I>

that contains the string pointed to by
<I>path1</I>

(<I>path2</I>

is the name of the symbolic link created,
<I>path1</I>

is the string contained in the symbolic link).
<P>

The string pointed to by
<I>path1</I>

shall be treated only as a character string and shall not be validated
as a pathname.
<P>

If the
<I>symlink</I>()
function fails for any reason other than
<B>[EIO]</B>,

any file named by
<I>path2</I>

shall be unaffected.
<P>

If
<I>path2</I>

names a symbolic link,
<I>symlink</I>()
shall fail and set
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>[EEXIST]</B>.

<P>

The symbolic link's user ID shall be set to the process' effective
user ID. The symbolic link's group ID shall be set to the group
ID of the parent directory or to the effective group ID of the
process. Implementations shall provide a way to initialize the symbolic
link's group ID to the group ID of the parent directory. Implementations
may, but need not, provide an implementation-defined way to initialize the
symbolic link's group ID to the effective group ID of the calling process.
<P>

The values of the file mode bits for the created symbolic link are
unspecified. All interfaces specified by POSIX.1-2008 shall behave as if the
contents of symbolic links can always be read, except that the value of
the file mode bits returned in the
<I>st_mode</I>

field of the
<B>stat</B>

structure is unspecified.
<P>

Upon successful completion,
<I>symlink</I>()
shall mark for update the last data access, last data modification,
and last file status change timestamps of the symbolic link. Also,
the last data modification and last file status change timestamps of
the directory that contains the new entry shall be marked for update.
<P>

The
<I>symlinkat</I>()
function shall be equivalent to the
<I>symlink</I>()
function except in the case where
<I>path2</I>

specifies a relative path. In this case the symbolic link is created
relative to the directory associated with the file descriptor
<I>fd</I>

instead of the current working directory. If the file descriptor was
opened without O_SEARCH, the function shall check whether directory
searches are permitted using the current permissions of the directory
underlying the file descriptor. If the file descriptor was opened with
O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the check.
<P>

If
<I>symlinkat</I>()
is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the
<I>fd</I>

parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the behavior
shall be identical to a call to
<I>symlink</I>().
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0.
Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set
<I>errno</I>

to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

These functions shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
Write permission is denied in the directory where the symbolic link is
being created, or search permission is denied for a component of the
path prefix of
<I>path2</I>.

<DT><B>EEXIST</B>

<DD>
The
<I>path2</I>

argument names an existing file.
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurs while reading from or writing to the file system.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the
<I>path2</I>

argument.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The length of a component of the pathname specified by the
<I>path2</I>

argument is longer than
{NAME_MAX}
or the length of the
<I>path1</I>

argument is longer than
{SYMLINK_MAX}.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix of
<I>path2</I>

does not name an existing file or
<I>path2</I>

is an empty string.
<DT><B>ENOSPC</B>

<DD>
The directory in which the entry for the new symbolic link is being
placed cannot be extended because no space is left on the file system
containing the directory, or the new symbolic link cannot be created
because no space is left on the file system which shall contain the
link, or the file system is out of file-allocation resources.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix of
<I>path2</I>

names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link
to a directory.
<DT><B>EROFS</B>

<DD>
The new symbolic link would reside on a read-only file system.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>symlinkat</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
<I>fd</I>

was not opened with O_SEARCH and the permissions of the directory
underlying
<I>fd</I>

do not permit directory searches.
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The
<I>path2</I>

argument does not specify an absolute path and the
<I>fd</I>

argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor open for reading
or searching.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
The
<I>path2</I>

argument is not an absolute path and
<I>fd</I>

is a file descriptor associated with a non-directory file.
</DL>
<P>

These functions may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
More than
{SYMLOOP_MAX}
symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the
<I>path2</I>

argument.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The length of the
<I>path2</I>

argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX}
or pathname resolution of a symbolic link in the
<I>path2</I>

argument produced an intermediate result with a length that exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.
</DL>
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

Like a hard link, a symbolic link allows a file to have multiple
logical names. The presence of a hard link guarantees the existence of
a file, even after the original name has been removed. A symbolic link
provides no such assurance; in fact, the file named by the
<I>path1</I>

argument need not exist when the link is created. A symbolic link can
cross file system boundaries.
<P>

Normal permission checks are made on each component of the symbolic
link pathname during its resolution.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

The purpose of the
<I>symlinkat</I>()
function is to create symbolic links in directories other than the
current working directory without exposure to race conditions. Any part
of the path of a file could be changed in parallel to a call to
<I>symlink</I>(),
resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file descriptor for
the target directory and using the
<I>symlinkat</I>()
function it can be guaranteed that the created symbolic link is located
relative to the desired directory.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</H2>

None.
