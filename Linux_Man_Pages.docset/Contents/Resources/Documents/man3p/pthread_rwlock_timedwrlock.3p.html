pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock
--- lock a read-write lock for writing
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</A>&gt;
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/time.h">time.h</A>&gt;

int pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *restrict <I>rwlock</I>,
    const struct timespec *restrict <I>abstime</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</I>()
function shall apply a write lock to the read-write lock referenced by
<I>rwlock</I>

as in the
<I>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</I>()
function. However, if the lock cannot be acquired without waiting for
other threads to unlock the lock, this wait shall be terminated when
the specified timeout expires. The timeout shall expire when the
absolute time specified by
<I>abstime</I>

passes, as measured by the clock on which timeouts are based (that is,
when the value of that clock equals or exceeds
<I>abstime</I>),

or if the absolute time specified by
<I>abstime</I>

has already been passed at the time of the call.
<P>

The timeout shall be based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.
The resolution of the timeout shall be the resolution of the
CLOCK_REALTIME clock. The
<B>timespec</B>

data type is defined in the
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/time.h">time.h</A>&gt;</I>

header. Under no circumstances shall the function fail with a timeout
if the lock can be acquired immediately. The validity of the
<I>abstime</I>

parameter need not be checked if the lock can be immediately acquired.
<P>

If a signal that causes a signal handler to be executed is delivered to
a thread blocked on a read-write lock via a call to
<I>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</I>(),
upon return from the signal handler the thread shall resume waiting for
the lock as if it was not interrupted.
<P>

The calling thread may deadlock if at the time the call is made it
holds the read-write lock. The results are undefined if this function
is called with an uninitialized read-write lock.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

The
<I>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</I>()
function shall return zero if the lock for writing on the read-write
lock object referenced by
<I>rwlock</I>

is acquired. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ETIMEDOUT</B>

<DD>
The lock could not be acquired before the specified timeout expired.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</I>()
function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EDEADLK</B>

<DD>
A deadlock condition was detected or the calling thread already holds the
<I>rwlock</I>.

<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The
<I>abstime</I>

nanosecond value is less than zero or greater than or equal to 1000
million.
</DL>
<P>

This function shall not return an error code of
<B>[EINTR]</B>.

<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

Applications using this function may be subject to priority inversion,
as discussed in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
<I>Section 3.287</I>, <I>Priority Inversion.</I>

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
<I>rwlock</I>

argument to
<I>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</I>()
does not refer to an initialized read-write lock object, it is
recommended that the function should fail and report an
<B>[EINVAL]</B>

error.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</H2>

None.
