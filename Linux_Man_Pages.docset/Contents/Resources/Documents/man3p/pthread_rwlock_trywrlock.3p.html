pthread_rwlock_trywrlock,
pthread_rwlock_wrlock
--- lock a read-write lock object for writing
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</A>&gt;

int pthread_rwlock_trywrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *<I>rwlock</I>);
int pthread_rwlock_wrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *<I>rwlock</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</I>()
function shall apply a write lock like the
<I>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</I>()
function, with the exception that the function shall fail if any thread
currently holds
<I>rwlock</I>

(for reading or writing).
<P>

The
<I>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</I>()
function shall apply a write lock to the read-write lock referenced by
<I>rwlock</I>.

The calling thread acquires the write lock if no other thread (reader
or writer) holds the read-write lock
<I>rwlock</I>.

Otherwise, the thread shall block until it can acquire the lock. The
calling thread may deadlock if at the time the call is made it holds
the read-write lock (whether a read or write lock).
<P>

Implementations may favor writers over readers to avoid
writer starvation.
<P>

Results are undefined if any of these functions are called with an
uninitialized read-write lock.
<P>

If a signal is delivered to a thread waiting for a read-write lock for
writing, upon return from the signal handler the thread resumes waiting
for the read-write lock for writing as if it was not interrupted.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

The
<I>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</I>()
function shall return zero if the lock for writing on the read-write
lock object referenced by
<I>rwlock</I>

is acquired. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
the error.
<P>

If successful, the
<I>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</I>()
function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EBUSY</B>

<DD>
The read-write lock could not be acquired for writing because it was
already locked for reading or writing.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</I>()
function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EDEADLK</B>

<DD>
A deadlock condition was detected or the current thread already owns
the read-write lock for writing or reading.
</DL>
<P>

These functions shall not return an error code of
<B>[EINTR]</B>.

<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

Applications using these functions may be subject to priority inversion,
as discussed in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
<I>Section 3.287</I>, <I>Priority Inversion.</I>

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
<I>rwlock</I>

argument to
<I>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</I>()
or
<I>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</I>()
does not refer to an initialized read-write lock object, it is
recommended that the function should fail and report an
<B>[EINVAL]</B>

error.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
