setreuid
--- set real and effective user IDs
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;

int setreuid(uid_t <I>ruid</I>, uid_t <I>euid</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>setreuid</I>()
function shall set the real and effective user IDs of the current
process to the values specified by the
<I>ruid</I>

and
<I>euid</I>

arguments. If
<I>ruid</I>

or
<I>euid</I>

is -1, the corresponding effective or real user ID of the current
process shall be left unchanged.
<P>

A process with appropriate privileges can set either ID to any value.
An unprivileged process can only set the effective user ID if the
<I>euid</I>

argument is equal to either the real, effective, or saved user ID of
the process.
<P>

If the real user ID is being set (<I>ruid</I>

is not -1), or the effective user ID is being set to a value not
equal to the real user ID, then the saved set-user-ID of the current
process shall be set equal to the new effective user ID.
<P>

It is unspecified whether a process without appropriate privileges is
permitted to change the real user ID to match the current effective user
ID or saved set-user-ID of the process.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
shall be returned and
<I>errno</I>

set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>setreuid</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value of the
<I>ruid</I>

or
<I>euid</I>

argument is invalid or out-of-range.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The current process does not have appropriate privileges, and either an
attempt was made to change the effective user ID to a value other than
the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID or an attempt was made to
change the real user ID to a value not permitted by the
implementation.

<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Setting the Effective User ID to the Real User ID</H3>

<P>

The following example sets the effective user ID of the calling process
to the real user ID, so that files created later will be owned by the
current user. It also sets the saved set-user-ID to the real user ID,
so any future attempt to set the effective user ID back to its previous
value will fail.

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

Earlier versions of this standard did not specify whether the saved
set-user-ID was affected by
<I>setreuid</I>()
calls. This version specifies common existing practice that constitutes
an important security feature. The ability to set both the effective user
ID and saved set-user-ID to be the same as the real user ID means that
any security weakness in code that is executed after that point cannot
result in malicious code being executed with the previous effective user
ID. Privileged applications could already do this using just
<I>setuid</I>(),
but for non-privileged applications the only standard method available
is to use this feature of
<I>setreuid</I>().
