<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/socket.h">sys/socket.h</A>&gt;

int connect(int <I>socket</I>, const struct sockaddr *<I>address</I>,
    socklen_t <I>address_len</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>connect</I>()
function shall attempt to make a connection on a connection-mode
socket or to set or reset the peer address of a connectionless-mode
socket. The function takes the following arguments:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>socket</I><DD>
Specifies the file descriptor associated with the socket.
<DT><I>address</I><DD>
Points to a
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure containing the peer address. The length and format of the
address depend on the address family of the socket.
<DT><I>address_len</I><DD>
Specifies the length of the
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure pointed to by the
<I>address</I>

argument.
</DL>
<P>

If the socket has not already been bound to a local address,
<I>connect</I>()
shall bind it to an address which, unless the socket's address family
is AF_UNIX, is an unused local address.
<P>

If the initiating socket is not connection-mode, then
<I>connect</I>()
shall set the socket's peer address, and no connection is made. For
SOCK_DGRAM sockets, the peer address identifies where all datagrams are
sent on subsequent
<I>send</I>()
functions, and limits the remote sender for subsequent
<I>recv</I>()
functions. If the
<I>sa_family</I>

member of
<I>address</I>

is AF_UNSPEC, the socket's peer address shall be reset. Note that despite
no connection being made, the term ``connected'' is used to describe a
connectionless-mode socket for which a peer address has been set.
<P>

If the initiating socket is connection-mode, then
<I>connect</I>()
shall attempt to establish a connection to the address specified by the
<I>address</I>

argument. If the connection cannot be established immediately and
O_NONBLOCK is not set for the file descriptor for the socket,
<I>connect</I>()
shall block for up to an unspecified timeout interval until the
connection is established. If the timeout interval expires before the
connection is established,
<I>connect</I>()
shall fail and the connection attempt shall be aborted. If
<I>connect</I>()
is interrupted by a signal that is caught while blocked waiting to
establish a connection,
<I>connect</I>()
shall fail and set
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>[EINTR]</B>,

but the connection request shall not be aborted, and the connection
shall be established asynchronously.
<P>

If the connection cannot be established immediately and O_NONBLOCK is
set for the file descriptor for the socket,
<I>connect</I>()
shall fail and set
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>[EINPROGRESS]</B>,

but the connection request shall not be aborted, and the connection
shall be established asynchronously. Subsequent calls to
<I>connect</I>()
for the same socket, before the connection is established, shall fail
and set
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>[EALREADY]</B>.

<P>

When the connection has been established asynchronously,
<I>pselect</I>(),
<I>select</I>(),
and
<I>poll</I>()
shall indicate that the file descriptor for the socket is ready for
writing.
<P>

The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate
privileges to use the
<I>connect</I>()
function.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion,
<I>connect</I>()
shall return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and
<I>errno</I>

set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>connect</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EADDRNOTAVAIL</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The specified address is not available from the local machine.
<DT><B>EAFNOSUPPORT</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The specified address is not a valid address for the address family of
the specified socket.
<DT><B>EALREADY</B>

<DD>
A connection request is already in progress for the specified socket.
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The
<I>socket</I>

argument is not a valid file descriptor.
<DT><B>ECONNREFUSED</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The target address was not listening for connections or refused the
connection request.
<DT><B>EINPROGRESS</B>

<DD>
O_NONBLOCK is set for the file descriptor for the socket and the
connection cannot be immediately established; the connection shall be
established asynchronously.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
The attempt to establish a connection was interrupted by delivery of a
signal that was caught; the connection shall be established
asynchronously.
<DT><B>EISCONN</B>

<DD>
The specified socket is connection-mode and is already connected.
<DT><B>ENETUNREACH</B>

<DD>
<BR>

No route to the network is present.
<DT><B>ENOTSOCK</B>

<DD>
The
<I>socket</I>

argument does not refer to a socket.
<DT><B>EPROTOTYPE</B>

<DD>
The specified address has a different type than the socket bound to the
specified peer address.
<DT><B>ETIMEDOUT</B>

<DD>
The attempt to connect timed out before a connection was made.
</DL>
<P>

If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then
<I>connect</I>()
shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

{NAME_MAX}.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

pathname is an empty string.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix of the pathname in
<I>address</I>

names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link
to a directory, or the pathname in
<I>address</I>

contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
character and ends with one or more trailing
&lt;slash&gt;
characters and the last pathname component names an existing file that
is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.
