pthread_barrier_wait
--- synchronize at a barrier
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</A>&gt;

int pthread_barrier_wait(pthread_barrier_t *<I>barrier</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>pthread_barrier_wait</I>()
function shall synchronize participating threads at the barrier
referenced by
<I>barrier</I>.

The calling thread shall block until the required number of
threads have called
<I>pthread_barrier_wait</I>()
specifying the barrier.
<P>

When the required number of threads have called
<I>pthread_barrier_wait</I>()
specifying the barrier, the constant PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD
shall be returned to one unspecified thread and zero shall be returned
to each of the remaining threads. At this point, the barrier shall be
reset to the state it had as a result of the most recent
<I>pthread_barrier_init</I>()
function that referenced it.
<P>

The constant PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD is defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</A>&gt;</I>

and its value shall be distinct from any other value returned by
<I>pthread_barrier_wait</I>().
<P>

The results are undefined if this function is called with an
uninitialized barrier.
<P>

If a signal is delivered to a thread blocked on a barrier, upon return
from the signal handler the thread shall resume waiting at the barrier
if the barrier wait has not completed (that is, if the required number
of threads have not arrived at the barrier during the execution of the
signal handler); otherwise, the thread shall continue as normal from
the completed barrier wait. Until the thread in the signal handler
returns from it, it is unspecified whether other threads may proceed
past the barrier once they have all reached it.
<P>

A thread that has blocked on a barrier shall not prevent any unblocked
thread that is eligible to use the same processing resources from
eventually making forward progress in its execution. Eligibility for
processing resources shall be determined by the scheduling policy.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion, the
<I>pthread_barrier_wait</I>()
function shall return PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD for a single
(arbitrary) thread synchronized at the barrier and zero for each of the
other threads. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

This function shall not return an error code of
<B>[EINTR]</B>.

<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

Applications using this function may be subject to priority inversion,
as discussed in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
<I>Section 3.287</I>, <I>Priority Inversion.</I>

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
<I>barrier</I>

argument to
<I>pthread_barrier_wait</I>()
does not refer to an initialized barrier object, it is recommended
that the function should fail and report an
<B>[EINVAL]</B>

error.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
