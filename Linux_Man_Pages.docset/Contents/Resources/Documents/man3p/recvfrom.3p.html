<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>recvfrom</I>()
function shall receive a message from a connection-mode or
connectionless-mode socket. It is normally used with
connectionless-mode sockets because it permits the application to
retrieve the source address of received data.
<P>

The
<I>recvfrom</I>()
function takes the following arguments:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>socket</I><DD>
Specifies the socket file descriptor.
<DT><I>buffer</I><DD>
Points to the buffer where the message should be stored.
<DT><I>length</I><DD>
Specifies the length in bytes of the buffer pointed to by the
<I>buffer</I>

argument.
<DT><I>flags</I><DD>
Specifies the type of message reception. Values of this argument are
formed by logically OR'ing zero or more of the following values:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>MSG_PEEK<DD>
Peeks at an incoming message. The data is treated as unread and the
next
<I>recvfrom</I>()
or similar function shall still return this data.
<DT>MSG_OOB<DD>
Requests out-of-band data. The significance and semantics of
out-of-band data are protocol-specific.
<DT>MSG_WAITALL<DD>
On SOCK_STREAM sockets this requests that the function block until the
full amount of data can be returned. The function may return the
smaller amount of data if the socket is a message-based socket, if a
signal is caught, if the connection is terminated, if MSG_PEEK was
specified, or if an error is pending for the socket.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><I>address</I><DD>
A null pointer, or points to a
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure in which the sending address is to be stored. The length and
format of the address depend on the address family of the socket.
<DT><I>address_len</I><DD>
Either a null pointer, if
<I>address</I>

is a null pointer, or a pointer to a
<B>socklen_t</B>

object which on input specifies the length of the supplied
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure, and on output specifies the length of the stored address.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>recvfrom</I>()
function shall return the length of the message written to the buffer
pointed to by the
<I>buffer</I>

argument. For message-based sockets, such as
SOCK_RAW,
SOCK_DGRAM, and SOCK_SEQPACKET, the entire message shall be read in a
single operation. If a message is too long to fit in the supplied
buffer, and MSG_PEEK is not set in the
<I>flags</I>

argument, the excess bytes shall be discarded. For stream-based
sockets, such as SOCK_STREAM, message boundaries shall be ignored. In
this case, data shall be returned to the user as soon as it becomes
available, and no data shall be discarded.
<P>

If the MSG_WAITALL flag is not set, data shall be returned only up to
the end of the first message.
<P>

Not all protocols provide the source address for messages. If the
<I>address</I>

argument is not a null pointer and the protocol provides the source
address of messages, the source address of the received message shall
be stored in the
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure pointed to by the
<I>address</I>

argument, and the length of this address shall be stored in the object
pointed to by the
<I>address_len</I>

argument.
<P>

If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of the
supplied
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure, the stored address shall be truncated.
<P>

If the
<I>address</I>

argument is not a null pointer and the protocol does not provide the
source address of messages, the value stored in the object pointed to
by
<I>address</I>

is unspecified.
<P>

If no messages are available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is not set on
the socket's file descriptor,
<I>recvfrom</I>()
shall block until a message arrives. If no messages are available at
the socket and O_NONBLOCK is set on the socket's file descriptor,
<I>recvfrom</I>()
shall fail and set
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>[EAGAIN]</B>

or
<B>[EWOULDBLOCK]</B>.

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion,
<I>recvfrom</I>()
shall return the length of the message in bytes. If no messages are
available to be received and the peer has performed an orderly
shutdown,
<I>recvfrom</I>()
shall return 0. Otherwise, the function shall return -1 and set
<I>errno</I>

to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>recvfrom</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B> or <B>EWOULDBLOCK</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and no data is
waiting to be received; or MSG_OOB is set and no out-of-band data is
available and either the socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK
or the socket does not support blocking to await out-of-band data.
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The
<I>socket</I>

argument is not a valid file descriptor.
<DT><B>ECONNRESET</B>

<DD>
A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
A signal interrupted
<I>recvfrom</I>()
before any data was available.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The MSG_OOB flag is set and no out-of-band data is available.
<DT><B>ENOTCONN</B>

<DD>
A receive is attempted on a connection-mode socket that is not connected.
<DT><B>ENOTSOCK</B>

<DD>
The
<I>socket</I>

argument does not refer to a socket.
<DT><B>EOPNOTSUPP</B>

<DD>
The specified flags are not supported for this socket type.
<DT><B>ETIMEDOUT</B>

<DD>
The connection timed out during connection establishment, or due to a
transmission timeout on active connection.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>recvfrom</I>()
function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file
system.
<DT><B>ENOBUFS</B>

<DD>
Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the
operation.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.
