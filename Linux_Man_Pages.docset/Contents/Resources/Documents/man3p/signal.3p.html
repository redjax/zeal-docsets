This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.
The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/signal.h">signal.h</A>&gt;

void (*signal(int <I>sig</I>, void (*<I>func</I>)(int)))(int);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO&nbsp;C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO&nbsp;C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1-2008 defers to the ISO&nbsp;C standard.
<P>

Use of this function is unspecified in a multi-threaded process.
<P>

The
<I>signal</I>()
function chooses one of three ways in which receipt of the signal
number
<I>sig</I>

is to be subsequently handled. If the value of
<I>func</I>

is SIG_DFL, default handling for that signal shall occur.
If the value of
<I>func</I>

is SIG_IGN, the signal shall be ignored.
Otherwise, the application shall ensure that
<I>func</I>

points to a function to be called when that signal occurs. An
invocation of such a function because of a signal, or (recursively) of
any further functions called by that invocation (other than functions
in the standard library), is called a ``signal handler''.
<P>

When a signal occurs, and
<I>func</I>

points to a function, it is implementation-defined whether the
equivalent of a:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
signal(</B><I>sig</I>, SIG_DFL);
</PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

is executed or the implementation prevents some implementation-defined
set of signals (at least including
<I>sig</I>)

from occurring until the current signal handling has completed. (If the
value of
<I>sig</I>

is SIGILL, the implementation may alternatively define that no action
is taken.) Next the equivalent of:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
(*func)(sig);
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

is executed. If and when the function returns, if the value of
<I>sig</I>

was SIGFPE, SIGILL, or SIGSEGV or any other implementation-defined
value corresponding to
a computational exception, the behavior is undefined. Otherwise, the
program shall resume execution at the point it was interrupted. The
ISO&nbsp;C standard places a restriction on applications relating to the use of
<I>raise</I>()
from signal handlers.
This restriction does not apply to POSIX applications, as POSIX.1-2008 requires
<I>raise</I>()
to be async-signal-safe (see
<I>Section 2.4.3</I>, <I>Signal Actions).</I>

<P>

If the process is multi-threaded,
or if the process is single-threaded and a signal handler is
executed other than as the result of:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
The process calling
<I>abort</I>(),
<I>raise</I>(),
<I>kill</I>(),
<I>pthread_kill</I>(),
or
<I>sigqueue</I>()
to generate a signal that is not blocked
<DT> *<DD>
A pending signal being unblocked and being delivered before the call
that unblocked it returns
</DL>
<P>

the behavior is undefined if the signal handler refers to any object
other than
<I>errno</I>

with static storage duration other than by assigning a value to an
object declared as
<B>volatile sig_atomic_t</B>,

or if the signal handler calls any function defined in this standard
other than
one of the functions listed in
<I>Section 2.4</I>, <I>Signal Concepts.</I>

<P>

At program start-up, the equivalent of:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
signal(</B><I>sig</I>, SIG_IGN);
</PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

is executed for some signals, and the equivalent of:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
signal(</B><I>sig</I>, SIG_DFL);
</PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

is executed for all other signals
(see
<I>exec</I>).

<P>

The
<I>signal</I>()
function shall not change the setting of
<I>errno</I>

if successful.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

If the request can be honored,
<I>signal</I>()
shall return the value of
<I>func</I>

for the most recent call to
<I>signal</I>()
for the specified signal
<I>sig</I>.

Otherwise, SIG_ERR shall be returned and a positive value shall
be stored in
<I>errno</I>.

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>signal</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The
<I>sig</I>

argument is not a valid signal number or an attempt is made to catch a
signal that cannot be caught or ignore a signal that cannot be
ignored.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>signal</I>()
function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
An attempt was made to set the action to SIG_DFL for a signal that
cannot be caught or ignored (or both).
</DL>
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

The
<I>sigaction</I>()
function provides a more comprehensive and reliable mechanism for
controlling signals; new applications should use
<I>sigaction</I>()
rather than
<I>signal</I>().
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
