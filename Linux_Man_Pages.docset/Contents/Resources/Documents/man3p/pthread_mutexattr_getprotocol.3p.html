pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol,

--- get and set the protocol attribute of the mutex attributes object

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</A>&gt;

int pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol(const pthread_mutexattr_t

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</I>()
and
<I>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</I>()
functions, respectively, shall get and set the protocol attribute of
a mutex attributes object pointed to by
<I>attr</I>

which was previously created by the function
<I>pthread_mutexattr_init</I>().
<P>

The
<I>protocol</I>

attribute defines the protocol to be followed in utilizing mutexes.
The value of
<I>protocol</I>

may be one of:
<P>

<PRE>
PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT
PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE
PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT
</PRE>

<P>

which are defined in the
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</A>&gt;</I>

header. The default value of the attribute shall be PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE.
<P>

When a thread owns a mutex with the PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE
<I>protocol</I>

attribute, its priority and scheduling shall not be affected by
its mutex ownership.
<P>

When a thread is blocking higher priority threads because of owning one
or more robust mutexes with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT
<I>protocol</I>

attribute, it shall execute at the higher of its priority or the priority
of the highest priority thread waiting on any of the robust mutexes
owned by this thread and initialized with this protocol.
<P>

When a thread is blocking higher priority threads because of owning one
or more non-robust mutexes with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT
<I>protocol</I>

attribute, it shall execute at the higher of its priority or the priority
of the highest priority thread waiting on any of the non-robust mutexes
owned by this thread and initialized with this protocol.
<P>

When a thread owns one or more robust mutexes initialized with the
PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol, it shall execute at the higher of its
priority or the highest of the priority ceilings of all the robust mutexes
owned by this thread and initialized with this attribute, regardless of
whether other threads are blocked on any of these robust mutexes or not.
<P>

When a thread owns one or more non-robust mutexes initialized with the
PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol, it shall execute at the higher of its
priority or the highest of the priority ceilings of all the non-robust
mutexes owned by this thread and initialized with this attribute,
regardless of whether other threads are blocked on any of these non-robust
mutexes or not.
<P>

While a thread is holding a mutex which has been initialized with the
PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol attributes, it
shall not be subject to being moved to the tail of the scheduling queue
at its priority in the event that its original priority is changed,
such as by a call to
<I>sched_setparam</I>().
Likewise, when a thread unlocks a mutex that has been initialized with
the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol attributes,
it shall not be subject to being moved to the tail of the scheduling
queue at its priority in the event that its original priority is
changed.
<P>

If a thread simultaneously owns several mutexes initialized with
different protocols, it shall execute at the highest of the priorities
that it would have obtained by each of these protocols.
<P>

When a thread makes a call to
<I>pthread_mutex_lock</I>(),
the mutex was initialized with the protocol attribute having the value
PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT, when the calling thread is blocked because the
mutex is owned by another thread, that owner thread shall inherit the
priority level of the calling thread as long as it continues to own the
mutex. The implementation shall update its execution priority to the
maximum of its assigned priority and all its inherited priorities.
Furthermore, if this owner thread itself becomes blocked on another
mutex with the
<I>protocol</I>

attribute having the value PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT, the same priority
inheritance effect shall be propagated to this other owner thread,
in a recursive manner.
<P>

The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the
<I>attr</I>

argument to
<I>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</I>()
or
<I>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</I>()
does not refer to an initialized mutex attributes object.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion, the
<I>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</I>()
and
<I>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</I>()
functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ENOTSUP</B>

<DD>
The value specified by
<I>protocol</I>

is an unsupported value.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</I>()
and
<I>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</I>()
functions may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value specified by
<I>protocol</I>

is invalid.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The caller does not have the privilege to perform the operation.
</DL>
<P>

These functions shall not return an error code of
<B>[EINTR]</B>.

<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
<I>attr</I>

argument to
<I>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</I>()
or
<I>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</I>()
does not refer to an initialized mutex attributes object, it is
recommended that the function should fail and report an
<B>[EINVAL]</B>

error.

<H2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</H2>
