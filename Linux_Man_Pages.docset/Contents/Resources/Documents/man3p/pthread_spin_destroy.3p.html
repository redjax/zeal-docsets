<H2>NAME</H2>

pthread_spin_destroy,
pthread_spin_init
--- destroy or initialize a spin lock object
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</A>&gt;

int pthread_spin_destroy(pthread_spinlock_t *<I>lock</I>);
int pthread_spin_init(pthread_spinlock_t *<I>lock</I>, int <I>pshared</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>pthread_spin_destroy</I>()
function shall destroy the spin lock referenced by
<I>lock</I>

and release any resources used by the lock. The effect of subsequent
use of the lock is undefined until the lock is reinitialized by another
call to
<I>pthread_spin_init</I>().
The results are undefined if
<I>pthread_spin_destroy</I>()
is called when a thread holds the lock, or if this function is called
with an uninitialized thread spin lock.
<P>

The
<I>pthread_spin_init</I>()
function shall allocate any resources required to use the spin lock
referenced by
<I>lock</I>

and initialize the lock to an unlocked state.
<P>

If the Thread Process-Shared Synchronization option is supported and
the value of
<I>pshared</I>

is PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED, the implementation
shall permit the spin lock to be operated upon by any thread that has
access to the memory where the spin lock is allocated, even if it is
allocated in memory that is shared by multiple processes.
<P>

If the Thread Process-Shared Synchronization option is supported and
the value of
<I>pshared</I>

is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE,
or if the option is not supported, the spin lock shall only be operated
upon by threads created within the same process as the thread that
initialized the spin lock. If threads of differing processes attempt to
operate on such a spin lock, the behavior is undefined.
<P>

The results are undefined if
<I>pthread_spin_init</I>()
is called specifying an already initialized spin lock. The results are
undefined if a spin lock is used without first being initialized.
<P>

If the
<I>pthread_spin_init</I>()
function fails, the lock is not initialized and the contents of
<I>lock</I>

are undefined.
<P>

Only the object referenced by
<I>lock</I>

may be used for performing synchronization.
<P>

The result of referring to copies of that object in calls to
<I>pthread_spin_destroy</I>(),
<I>pthread_spin_lock</I>(),
<I>pthread_spin_trylock</I>(),
or
<I>pthread_spin_unlock</I>()
is undefined.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion, these functions shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>pthread_spin_init</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
The system lacks the necessary resources to initialize another spin
lock.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient memory exists to initialize the lock.
</DL>
<P>

These functions shall not return an error code of
<B>[EINTR]</B>.

<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
<I>lock</I>

argument to
<I>pthread_spin_destroy</I>()
does not refer to an initialized spin lock object, it is recommended
that the function should fail and report an
<B>[EINVAL]</B>

error.
<P>

If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
<I>lock</I>

argument to
<I>pthread_spin_destroy</I>()
or
<I>pthread_spin_init</I>()
refers to a locked spin lock object, or detects that the value specified
by the
<I>lock</I>

argument to
<I>pthread_spin_init</I>()
refers to an already initialized spin lock object, it is recommended
that the function should fail and report an
<B>[EBUSY]</B>

error.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
