lseek
--- move the read/write file offset
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;

off_t lseek(int <I>fildes</I>, off_t <I>offset</I>, int <I>whence</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>lseek</I>()
function shall set the file offset for the open file description
associated with the file descriptor
<I>fildes,</I>

as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
If
<I>whence</I>

is SEEK_SET, the file offset shall be set to
<I>offset</I>

bytes.
<DT> *<DD>
If
<I>whence</I>

is SEEK_CUR, the file offset shall be set to its current location plus
<I>offset</I>.

<DT> *<DD>
If
<I>whence</I>

is SEEK_END, the file offset shall be set to the size of the file plus
<I>offset</I>.

</DL>
<P>

The symbolic constants SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, and SEEK_END
are defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;</I>.

<P>

The behavior of
<I>lseek</I>()
on devices which are incapable of seeking is implementation-defined.
The value of the file offset associated with such a device is
undefined.
<P>

The
<I>lseek</I>()
function shall allow the file offset to be set beyond the end of the
existing data in the file. If data is later written at this point,
subsequent reads of data in the gap shall return bytes with the value 0
until data is actually written into the gap.
<P>

The
<I>lseek</I>()
function shall not, by itself, extend the size of a file.
<P>

If
<I>fildes</I>

refers to a shared memory object, the result of the
<I>lseek</I>()
function is unspecified.
<P>

If
<I>fildes</I>

refers to a typed memory object, the result of the
<I>lseek</I>()
function is unspecified.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion, the resulting offset, as measured in bytes
from the beginning of the file, shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
shall be returned,
<I>errno</I>

shall be set to indicate the error, and the file offset shall remain
unchanged.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>lseek</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The
<I>fildes</I>

argument is not an open file descriptor.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The
<I>whence</I>

argument is not a proper value, or the resulting file offset would be
negative for a regular file, block special file, or directory.
<DT><B>EOVERFLOW</B>

<DD>
The resulting file offset would be a value which cannot be represented
correctly in an object of type
<B>off_t</B>.

<DT><B>ESPIPE</B>

<DD>
The
<I>fildes</I>

argument is associated with a pipe, FIFO, or socket.
</DL>
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

The ISO&nbsp;C standard includes the functions
<I>fgetpos</I>()
and
<I>fsetpos</I>(),
which work on very large files by use of a special positioning type.
<P>

Although
<I>lseek</I>()
may position the file offset beyond the end of the file, this function
does not itself extend the size of the file. While the only function
in POSIX.1-2008 that may directly extend the size of the file is
<I>write</I>(),
<I>truncate</I>(),
and
<I>ftruncate</I>(),
several functions originally derived from the ISO&nbsp;C standard, such as
<I>fwrite</I>(),
<I>fprintf</I>(),
and so on, may do so (by causing calls on
<I>write</I>()).
<P>

An invalid file offset that would cause
<B>[EINVAL]</B>

to be returned may be both implementation-defined and
device-dependent (for example, memory may have few invalid values). A
negative file offset may be valid for some devices in some
implementations.
<P>

The POSIX.1-1990 standard did not specifically prohibit
<I>lseek</I>()
from returning a negative offset. Therefore, an application was
required to clear
<I>errno</I>

prior to the call and check
<I>errno</I>

upon return to determine whether a return value of (<B>off_t</B>)-1

is a negative offset or an indication of an error condition. The
standard developers did not wish to require this action on the part of
a conforming application, and chose to require that
<I>errno</I>

be set to
<B>[EINVAL]</B>

when the resulting file offset would be negative for a regular file,
block special file, or directory.
