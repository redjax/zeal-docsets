</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>recvmsg</I>()
function shall receive a message from a connection-mode or
connectionless-mode socket. It is normally used with
connectionless-mode sockets because it permits the application to
retrieve the source address of received data.
<P>

The
<I>recvmsg</I>()
function takes the following arguments:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>socket</I><DD>
Specifies the socket file descriptor.
<DT><I>message</I><DD>
Points to a
<B>msghdr</B>

structure, containing both the buffer to store the source address and
the buffers for the incoming message. The length and format of the
address depend on the address family of the socket. The
<I>msg_flags</I>

member is ignored on input, but may contain meaningful values on
output.
<DT><I>flags</I><DD>
Specifies the type of message reception. Values of this argument are
formed by logically OR'ing zero or more of the following values:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>MSG_OOB<DD>
Requests out-of-band data. The significance and semantics of
out-of-band data are protocol-specific.
<DT>MSG_PEEK<DD>
Peeks at the incoming message.
<DT>MSG_WAITALL<DD>
On SOCK_STREAM sockets this requests that the function block until the
full amount of data can be returned. The function may return the
smaller amount of data if the socket is a message-based socket, if a
signal is caught, if the connection is terminated, if MSG_PEEK was
specified, or if an error is pending for the socket.
</DL>
</DL>

</DL>
<P>

The
<I>recvmsg</I>()
function shall receive messages from unconnected or connected
sockets and shall return the length of the message.
<P>

The
<I>recvmsg</I>()
function shall return the total length of the message. For
message-based sockets, such as SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET, the
entire message shall be read in a single operation. If a message is too
long to fit in the supplied buffers, and MSG_PEEK is not set in the
<I>flags</I>

argument, the excess bytes shall be discarded, and MSG_TRUNC shall be
set in the
<I>msg_flags</I>

member of the
<B>msghdr</B>

structure. For stream-based sockets, such as SOCK_STREAM, message
boundaries shall be ignored. In this case, data shall be returned to
the user as soon as it becomes available, and no data shall be
discarded.
<P>

If the MSG_WAITALL flag is not set, data shall be returned only up to
the end of the first message.
<P>

If no messages are available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is not set on
the socket's file descriptor,
<I>recvmsg</I>()
shall block until a message arrives. If no messages are available at
the socket and O_NONBLOCK is set on the socket's file descriptor, the
<I>recvmsg</I>()
function shall fail and set
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>[EAGAIN]</B>

or
<B>[EWOULDBLOCK]</B>.

<P>

In the
<B>msghdr</B>

structure, the
<I>msg_name</I>

member may be a null pointer if the source address is not required.
Otherwise, if the socket is unconnected, the
<I>msg_name</I>

member points to a
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure in which the source address is to be stored, and the
<I>msg_namelen</I>

member on input specifies the length of the supplied
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure and on output specifies the length of the stored address.
If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of the
supplied
<B>sockaddr</B>

structure, the stored address shall be truncated. If the socket is
connected, the
<I>msg_name</I>

and
<I>msg_namelen</I>

members shall be ignored. The
<I>msg_iov</I>

and
<I>msg_iovlen</I>

fields are used to specify where the received data shall be stored.
The
<I>msg_iov</I>

member points to an array of
<B>iovec</B>

structures; the
<I>msg_iovlen</I>

member shall be set to the dimension of this array. In each
<B>iovec</B>

structure, the
<I>iov_base</I>

field specifies a storage area and the
<I>iov_len</I>

field gives its size in bytes. Each storage area indicated by
<I>msg_iov</I>

is filled with received data in turn until all of the received data is
stored or all of the areas have been filled.
<P>

Upon successful completion, the
<I>msg_flags</I>

member of the message header shall be the bitwise-inclusive OR of all
of the following flags that indicate conditions detected for the
received message:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>MSG_EOR<DD>
End-of-record was received (if supported by the protocol).
<DT>MSG_OOB<DD>
Out-of-band data was received.
<DT>MSG_TRUNC<DD>
Normal data was truncated.
<DT>MSG_CTRUNC<DD>
Control data was truncated.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion,
<I>recvmsg</I>()
shall return the length of the message in bytes. If no messages are
available to be received and the peer has performed an orderly
shutdown,
<I>recvmsg</I>()
shall return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and
<I>errno</I>

set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>recvmsg</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B> or <B>EWOULDBLOCK</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and no data is
waiting to be received; or MSG_OOB is set and no out-of-band data is
available and either the socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK
or the socket does not support blocking to await out-of-band data.
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The
<I>socket</I>

argument is not a valid open file descriptor.
<DT><B>ECONNRESET</B>

<DD>
A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
This function was interrupted by a signal before any data was
available.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The sum of the
<I>iov_len</I>

values overflows a
<B>ssize_t</B>,

or the MSG_OOB flag is set and no out-of-band data is available.
<DT><B>EMSGSIZE</B>

<DD>
The
<I>msg_iovlen</I>

member of the
<B>msghdr</B>

structure pointed to by
<I>message</I>

is less than or equal to 0, or is greater than
{IOV_MAX}.
<DT><B>ENOTCONN</B>

<DD>
A receive is attempted on a connection-mode socket that is not
connected.
<DT><B>ENOTSOCK</B>

<DD>
The
<I>socket</I>

argument does not refer to a socket.
<DT><B>EOPNOTSUPP</B>

<DD>
The specified flags are not supported for this socket type.
<DT><B>ETIMEDOUT</B>

<DD>
The connection timed out during connection establishment, or due to a
transmission timeout on active connection.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>recvmsg</I>()
function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file
system.
<DT><B>ENOBUFS</B>

<DD>
Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the
operation.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.
