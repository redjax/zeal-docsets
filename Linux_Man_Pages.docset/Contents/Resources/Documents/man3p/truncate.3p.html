truncate
--- truncate a file to a specified length
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;

int truncate(const char *<I>path</I>, off_t <I>length</I>);
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>truncate</I>()
function shall cause the regular file named by
<I>path</I>

to have a size which shall be equal to
<I>length</I>

bytes.
<P>

If the file previously was larger than
<I>length</I>,

the extra data is discarded. If the file was previously shorter than
<I>length</I>,

its size is increased, and the extended area appears as if it were
zero-filled.
<P>

The application shall ensure that the process has write permission for
the file.
<P>

If the request would cause the file size to exceed the soft file size
limit for the process, the request shall fail and the implementation
shall generate the SIGXFSZ signal for the process.
<P>

The
<I>truncate</I>()
function shall not modify the file offset for any open file descriptions
associated with the file. Upon successful completion, if the file size
is changed,
<I>truncate</I>()
shall mark for update the last data modification and last file status
change timestamps of the file, and the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of the
file mode may be cleared.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion,
<I>truncate</I>()
shall return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, and
<I>errno</I>

set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<I>truncate</I>()
function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
A signal was caught during execution.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The
<I>length</I>

argument was less than 0.
<DT><B>EFBIG</B> or <B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The
<I>length</I>

argument was greater than the maximum file size.
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to a file system.
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix denies search permission, or write
permission is denied on the file.
<DT><B>EISDIR</B>

<DD>
The named file is a directory.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the
<I>path</I>

argument.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
A component of
<I>path</I>

does not name an existing file or
<I>path</I>

is an empty string.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither
a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory, or the
<I>path</I>

argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
character and ends with one or more trailing
&lt;slash&gt;
characters and the last pathname component names an existing file
that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.
<DT><B>EROFS</B>

<DD>
The named file resides on a read-only file system.
<BR>

</DL>
<P>

The
<I>truncate</I>()
function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
More than
{SYMLOOP_MAX}
symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the
<I>path</I>

argument.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The length of a pathname exceeds
{PATH_MAX},
or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
result with a length that exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.
