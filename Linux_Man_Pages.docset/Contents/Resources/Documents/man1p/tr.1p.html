<H2>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</H2>

The operands
<I>string1</I>

and
<I>string2</I>

(if specified) define two arrays of characters. The constructs in the
following list can be used to specify characters or single-character
collating elements. If any of the constructs result in multi-character
collating elements,
<I>tr</I>

shall exclude, without a diagnostic, those multi-character elements
from the resulting array.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>character</I><DD>
Any character not described by one of the conventions below shall
represent itself.
<DT>\<I>octal</I><DD>
Octal sequences can be used to represent characters with specific coded
values. An octal sequence shall consist of a
&lt;backslash&gt;
followed by the longest sequence of one, two, or three-octal-digit
characters (01234567). The sequence shall cause the value whose encoding
is represented by the one, two, or three-digit octal integer to be placed
into the array. Multi-byte characters require multiple, concatenated
escape sequences of this type, including the leading
&lt;backslash&gt;
for each byte.
<DT>\<I>character</I><DD>
The
&lt;backslash&gt;-escape
sequences in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
<I>Table 5-1</I>, <I>Escape Sequences and Associated Actions</I>

(<B>'\\'</B>,

<B>'\a'</B>,

<B>'\b'</B>,

<B>'\f'</B>,

<B>'\n'</B>,

<B>'\r'</B>,

<B>'\t'</B>,

<B>'\v'</B>)

shall be supported. The results of using any other character, other
than an octal digit, following the
&lt;backslash&gt;
are unspecified. Also, if there is no character following the
&lt;backslash&gt;,
the results are unspecified.
<DT><I>c</I>-<I>c</I><DD>
In the POSIX locale, this construct shall represent the range of
collating elements between the range endpoints (as long as neither
endpoint is an octal sequence of the form \<I>octal</I>), inclusive, as
defined by the collation sequence. The characters or collating elements
in the range shall be placed in the array in ascending collation
sequence. If the second endpoint precedes the starting endpoint in the
collation sequence, it is unspecified whether the range of collating
elements is empty, or this construct is treated as invalid. In locales
other than the POSIX locale, this construct has unspecified behavior.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<P>

If either or both of the range endpoints are octal sequences of the
form \<I>octal</I>, this shall represent the range of specific coded
values between the two range endpoints, inclusive.
</DL>

<DT>[:<I>class</I>:]<DD>
Represents all characters belonging to the defined character class, as
defined by the current setting of the
<I>LC_CTYPE</I>

locale category. The following character class names shall be accepted
when specified in
<I>string1</I>:

<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=top><TD><B>alnum</B></TD><TD><B>blank</B></TD><TD><B>digit</B></TD><TD><B>lower</B></TD><TD><B>punct</B></TD><TD><B>upper</B><BR></TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=top><TD><B>alpha</B></TD><TD><B>cntrl</B></TD><TD><B>graph</B></TD><TD><B>print</B></TD><TD><B>space</B></TD><TD><B>xdigit</B><BR></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<P>

In addition, character class expressions of the form [:<I>name</I>:]

shall be recognized in those locales where the
<I>name</I>

keyword has been given a
<B>charclass</B>

definition in the
<I>LC_CTYPE</I>

category.
<P>

When both the
<B>-d</B>

and
<B>-s</B>

options are specified, any of the character class names shall be
accepted in
<I>string2</I>.

Otherwise, only character class names
<B>lower</B>

or
<B>upper</B>

are valid in
<I>string2</I>

and then only if the corresponding character class (<B>upper</B>

and
<B>lower</B>,

respectively) is specified in the same relative position in
<I>string1</I>.

Such a specification shall be interpreted as a request for case
conversion. When [:<I>lower</I>:]

appears in
<I>string1</I>

and [:<I>upper</I>:]

appears in
<I>string2</I>,

the arrays shall contain the characters from the
<B>toupper</B>

mapping in the
<I>LC_CTYPE</I>

category of the current locale. When [:<I>upper</I>:]

appears in
<I>string1</I>

and [:<I>lower</I>:]

appears in
<I>string2</I>,

the arrays shall contain the characters from the
<B>tolower</B>

mapping in the
<I>LC_CTYPE</I>

category of the current locale. The first character from each mapping
pair shall be in the array for
<I>string1</I>

and the second character from each mapping pair shall be in the array
for
<I>string2</I>

in the same relative position.
<P>

Except for case conversion, the characters specified by a character
class expression shall be placed in the array in an unspecified order.
<P>

If the name specified for
<I>class</I>

does not define a valid character class in the current locale, the
behavior is undefined.
</DL>

<DT>[=<I>equiv</I>=]<DD>
Represents all characters or collating elements belonging to the same
equivalence class as
<I>equiv</I>,

as defined by the current setting of the
<I>LC_COLLATE</I>

locale category. An equivalence class expression shall be allowed only
in
<I>string1</I>,

or in
<I>string2</I>

when it is being used by the combined
<B>-d</B>

and
<B>-s</B>

options. The characters belonging to the equivalence class shall be
placed in the array in an unspecified order.
<DT>[<I>x</I>*<I>n</I>]<DD>
Represents
<I>n</I>

repeated occurrences of the character
<I>x</I>.

Because this expression is used to map multiple characters to one, it
is only valid when it occurs in
<I>string2</I>.

If
<I>n</I>

is omitted or is zero, it shall be interpreted as large enough to
extend the
<I>string2</I>-based

sequence to the length of the
<I>string1</I>-based

sequence. If
<I>n</I>

has a leading zero, it shall be interpreted as an octal value.
Otherwise, it shall be interpreted as a decimal value.
</DL>
<P>

When the
<B>-d</B>

option is not specified:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
If
<I>string2</I>

is present, each input character found in the array specified by
<I>string1</I>

shall be replaced by the character in the same relative position in the
array specified by
<I>string2</I>.

If the array specified by
<I>string2</I>

is shorter that the one specified by
<I>string1</I>,

or if a character occurs more than once in
<I>string1</I>,

the results are unspecified.
<DT> *<DD>
If the
<B>-C</B>

option is specified, the complements of the characters specified by
<I>string1</I>

(the set of all characters in the current character set, as defined by
the current setting of
<I>LC_CTYPE</I>,

except for those actually specified in the
<I>string1</I>

operand) shall be placed in the array in ascending collation sequence,
as defined by the current setting of
<I>LC_COLLATE</I>.

<DT> *<DD>
If the
<B>-c</B>

option is specified, the complement of the values specified by
<I>string1</I>

shall be placed in the array in ascending order by binary value.
<DT> *<DD>
Because the order in which characters specified by character class
expressions or equivalence class expressions is undefined, such
expressions should only be used if the intent is to map several
characters into one. An exception is case conversion, as described
previously.
</DL>
<P>

When the
<B>-d</B>

option is specified:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Input characters found in the array specified by
<I>string1</I>

shall be deleted.
<DT> *<DD>
When the
<B>-C</B>

option is specified with
<B>-d</B>,

all characters except those specified by
<I>string1</I>

shall be deleted. The contents of
<I>string2</I>

are ignored, unless the
<B>-s</B>

option is also specified.
<DT> *<DD>
When the
<B>-c</B>

option is specified with
<B>-d</B>,

all values except those specified by
<I>string1</I>

shall be deleted. The contents of
<I>string2</I>

shall be ignored, unless the
<B>-s</B>

option is also specified.
<DT> *<DD>
The same string cannot be used for both the
<B>-d</B>

and the
<B>-s</B>

option; when both options are specified, both
<I>string1</I>

(used for deletion) and
<I>string2</I>

(used for squeezing) shall be required.
</DL>
<P>

When the
<B>-s</B>

option is specified, after any deletions or translations have taken
place, repeated sequences of the same character shall be replaced by
one occurrence of the same character, if the character is found in the
array specified by the last operand. If the last operand contains a
character class, such as the following example:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
tr -s '[:space:]'
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

the last operand's array shall contain all of the characters in that
character class. However, in a case conversion, as described
previously, such as:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
tr -s '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

the last operand's array shall contain only those characters defined as
the second characters in each of the
<B>toupper</B>

or
<B>tolower</B>

character pairs, as appropriate.
<P>

An empty string used for
<I>string1</I>

or
<I>string2</I>

produces undefined results.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXIT STATUS</H2>

The following exit values shall be returned:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&nbsp;0<DD>
All input was processed successfully.
<DT>&gt;0<DD>
An error occurred.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</H2>

Default.
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>

<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

If necessary,
<I>string1</I>

and
<I>string2</I>

can be quoted to avoid pattern matching by the shell.
<P>

If an ordinary digit (representing itself) is to follow an octal
sequence, the octal sequence must use the full three digits to avoid
ambiguity.
<P>

When
<I>string2</I>

is shorter than
<I>string1</I>,

a difference results between historical System&nbsp;V and BSD systems. A
BSD system pads
<I>string2</I>

with the last character found in
<I>string2</I>.

Thus, it is possible to do the following:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
tr 0123456789 d
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

which would translate all digits to the letter
<B>'d'</B>.

Since this area is specifically unspecified in this volume of POSIX.1-2008, both the BSD and
System&nbsp;V behaviors are allowed, but a conforming application cannot rely
on the BSD behavior. It would have to code the example in the
following way:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
tr 0123456789 '[d*]'
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

It should be noted that, despite similarities in appearance, the string
operands used by
<I>tr</I>

are not regular expressions.
<P>

Unlike some historical implementations, this definition of the
<I>tr</I>

utility correctly processes NUL characters in its input stream. NUL
characters can be stripped by using:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
tr -d '\000'
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>

</DL>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

In some early proposals, an explicit option
<B>-n</B>

was added to disable the historical behavior of stripping NUL
characters from the input. It was considered that automatically
stripping NUL characters from the input was not correct functionality.
However, the removal of
<B>-n</B>

in a later proposal does not remove the requirement that
<I>tr</I>

correctly process NUL characters in its input stream. NUL characters
can be stripped by using
<I>tr</I>

<B>-d</B>

'\000'.
<P>

Historical implementations of
<I>tr</I>

differ widely in syntax and behavior. For example, the BSD version has
not needed the bracket characters for the repetition sequence. The
<I>tr</I>

utility syntax is based more closely on the System V and XPG3 model
while attempting to accommodate historical BSD implementations. In the
case of the short
<I>string2</I>

padding, the decision was to unspecify the behavior and preserve System
V and XPG3 scripts, which might find difficulty with the BSD method.
The assumption was made that BSD users of
<I>tr</I>

have to make accommodations to meet the syntax defined here. Since it
is possible to use the repetition sequence to duplicate the desired
behavior, whereas there is no simple way to achieve the System V
method, this was the correct, if not desirable, approach.
<P>

The use of octal values to specify control characters, while having
historical precedents, is not portable. The introduction of escape
sequences for control characters should provide the necessary
portability. It is recognized that this may cause some historical
scripts to break.
<P>

An early proposal included support for multi-character collating elements.
It was pointed out that, while
<I>tr</I>

does employ some syntactical elements from REs, the aim of
<I>tr</I>

is quite different; ranges, for example, do not have a similar meaning
(``any of the chars in the range matches'', <I>versus</I> ``translate
each character in the range to the output counterpart''). As a result,
the previously included support for multi-character collating elements
has been removed. What remains are ranges in current collation order
(to support, for example, accented characters), character classes, and
equivalence classes.
<P>

In XPG3 the [:<I>class</I>:]

and [=<I>equiv</I>=]

conventions are shown with double brackets, as in RE syntax. However,
<I>tr</I>

does not implement RE principles; it just borrows part of the syntax.
Consequently, [:<I>class</I>:]

and [=<I>equiv</I>=]

should be regarded as syntactical elements on a par with [<I>x</I>*<I>n</I>],

which is not an RE bracket expression.
<P>

The standard developers will consider changes to
<I>tr</I>

that allow it to translate characters between different character
encodings, or they will consider providing a new utility to accomplish
this.
<P>

On historical System V systems, a range expression requires enclosing
square-brackets, such as:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

However, BSD-based systems did not require the brackets, and this
convention is used here to avoid breaking large numbers of BSD scripts:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
tr a-z A-Z
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

The preceding System V script will continue to work because the
brackets, treated as regular characters, are translated to themselves.
However, any System V script that relied on
<B>&quot;a-z&quot;</B>

representing the three characters
<B>'a'</B>,

<B>'-'</B>,

and
<B>'z'</B>

have to be rewritten as
<B>&quot;az-&quot;</B>.

<P>

The ISO&nbsp;POSIX-2:1993 standard had a
<B>-c</B>

option that behaved similarly to the
<B>-C</B>

option, but did not supply functionality equivalent to the
<B>-c</B>

option specified in POSIX.1-2008. This meant that historical practice of being
able to specify
<I>tr</I>

<B>-cd</B>\000-\177

(which would delete all bytes with the top bit set) would have no
effect because, in the C locale, bytes with the values octal 200 to
octal 377 are not characters.
<P>

The earlier version also said that octal sequences referred to
collating elements and could be placed adjacent to each other to
specify multi-byte characters. However, it was noted that this caused
ambiguities because
<I>tr</I>

would not be able to tell whether adjacent octal sequences were
intending to specify multi-byte characters or multiple single byte
characters. POSIX.1-2008 specifies that octal sequences always refer to single
byte binary values when used to specify an endpoint of a range of
collating elements.
<P>

Earlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations with
bytes other than eight bits, but this has been modified in this
version.
