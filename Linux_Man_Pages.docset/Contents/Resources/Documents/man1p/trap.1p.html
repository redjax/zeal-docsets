<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

trap <I>n </I><B>[</B><I>condition</I>...<B>]</B>
trap <B>[</B><I>action condition</I>...<B>]</B>
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

If the first operand is an unsigned decimal integer, the shell shall
treat all operands as conditions, and shall reset each condition to
the default value. Otherwise, if there are operands, the first is
treated as an action and the remaining as conditions.
<P>

If
<I>action</I>

is
<B>'-'</B>,

the shell shall reset each
<I>condition</I>

to the default value. If
<I>action</I>

is null (<B>&quot;&quot;</B>),

the shell shall ignore each specified
<I>condition</I>

if it arises. Otherwise, the argument
<I>action</I>

shall be read and executed by the shell when one of the corresponding
conditions arises. The action of
<I>trap</I>

shall override a previous action (either default action or one
explicitly set). The value of
<B>&quot;$?&quot;</B>

after the
<I>trap</I>

action completes shall be the value it had before
<I>trap</I>

was invoked.
<P>

The condition can be EXIT, 0 (equivalent to EXIT), or a signal
specified using a symbolic name, without the SIG prefix, as listed in
the tables of signal names in the
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/signal.h">signal.h</A>&gt;</I>

header defined in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
<I>Chapter 13</I>, <I>Headers;</I>

for example, HUP, INT, QUIT, TERM. Implementations may permit names with
the SIG prefix or ignore case in signal names as an extension. Setting
a trap for SIGKILL or SIGSTOP produces undefined results.
<P>

The environment in which the shell executes a
<I>trap</I>

on EXIT shall be identical to the environment immediately after the
last command executed before the
<I>trap</I>

on EXIT was taken.
<P>

Each time
<I>trap</I>

is invoked, the
<I>action</I>

argument shall be processed in a manner equivalent to:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
eval </B><I>action</I>
</PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

Signals that were ignored on entry to a non-interactive shell cannot be
trapped or reset, although no error need be reported when attempting to
do so. An interactive shell may reset or catch signals ignored on
entry. Traps shall remain in place for a given shell until explicitly
changed with another
<I>trap</I>

command.
<P>

When a subshell is entered, traps that are not being ignored shall be
set to the default actions, except in the case of a command substitution
containing only a single
<I>trap</I>

command, when the traps need not be altered. Implementations may check
for this case using only lexical analysis; for example, if
<I>`trap`</I>

and
<I>$( trap -- )</I>

do not alter the traps in the subshell, cases such as assigning
<I>var=trap</I>

and then using
<I>$($var)</I>

may still alter them. This does not imply that the
<I>trap</I>

command cannot be used within the subshell to set new traps.
<P>

The
<I>trap</I>

command with no operands shall write to standard output a list of commands
associated with each condition. If the command is executed in a subshell,
the implementation does not perform the optional check described above
for a command substitution containing only a single
<I>trap</I>

command, and no
<I>trap</I>

commands with operands have been executed since entry to the subshell,
the list shall contain the commands that were associated with each
condition immediately before the subshell environment was entered.
Otherwise, the list shall contain the commands currently associated with
each condition. The format shall be:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
&quot;trap -- %s %s ...\n&quot;, &lt;</B><I>action</I>&gt;, &lt;<I>condition</I>&gt; ...
</PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of quoting,
so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as commands that
achieve the same trapping results. For example:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
save_traps=$(trap)
...
eval &quot;$save_traps&quot;
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

XSI-conformant systems also allow numeric signal numbers for the
conditions corresponding to the following signal names:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>
SIGHUP
<DT>2<DD>
SIGINT
<DT>3<DD>
SIGQUIT
<DT>6<DD>
SIGABRT
<DT>9<DD>
SIGKILL
<DT>14<DD>
SIGALRM
<DT>15<DD>
SIGTERM
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>trap</I>

special built-in shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
<I>Section 12.2</I>, <I>Utility Syntax Guidelines.</I>

invalid signal names

abort.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

Write out a list of all traps and actions:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
trap
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

Set a trap so the
<I>logout</I>

utility in the directory referred to by the
<I>HOME</I>

environment variable executes when the shell terminates:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
trap '&quot;$HOME&quot;/logout' EXIT
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

or:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
trap '&quot;$HOME&quot;/logout' 0
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

Unset traps on INT, QUIT, TERM, and EXIT:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
trap - INT QUIT TERM EXIT
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

Implementations may permit lowercase signal names as an extension.
Implementations may also accept the names with the SIG prefix; no known
historical shell does so. The
<I>trap</I>

and
<I>kill</I>

utilities in this volume of POSIX.1-2008 are now consistent in their omission of the SIG
prefix for signal names. Some
<I>kill</I>

implementations do not allow the prefix, and
<I>kill</I>

<B>-l</B>

lists the signals without prefixes.
<P>

Trapping SIGKILL or SIGSTOP is syntactically accepted by some
historical implementations, but it has no effect. Portable POSIX
applications cannot attempt to trap these signals.
<P>

The output format is not historical practice. Since the output of
historical
<I>trap</I>

commands is not portable (because numeric signal values are not
portable) and had to change to become so, an opportunity was taken to
format the output in a way that a shell script could use to save and
then later reuse a trap if it wanted.
<P>

The KornShell uses an
<B>ERR</B>

trap that is triggered whenever
<I>set</I>

<B>-e</B>

would cause an exit. This is allowable as an extension, but was not
mandated, as other shells have not used it.
<P>

The text about the environment for the EXIT trap invalidates the
behavior of some historical versions of interactive shells which, for
example, close the standard input before executing a trap on 0. For
example, in some historical interactive shell sessions the following
trap on 0 would always print
<B>&quot;--&quot;</B>:

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
trap 'read foo; echo &quot;-$foo-&quot;' 0
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

The command:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
trap 'eval &quot; $cmd&quot;' 0
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

causes the contents of the shell variable
<I>cmd</I>

to be executed as a command when the shell exits. Using:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
trap '$cmd' 0
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

does not work correctly if
<I>cmd</I>

contains any special characters such as quoting or redirections. Using:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
trap &quot; $cmd&quot; 0
</B></PRE>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

also works (the leading
&lt;space&gt;
character protects against unlikely cases where
<I>cmd</I>

is a decimal integer or begins with
<B>'-'</B>),

but it expands the
<I>cmd</I>

variable when the
<I>trap</I>

command is executed, not when the exit action is executed.
