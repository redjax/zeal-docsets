<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>bpf</B>()

system call performs a range of operations related to extended
Berkeley Packet Filters.
Extended BPF (or eBPF) is similar to
the original (&quot;classic&quot;) BPF (cBPF) used to filter network packets.
For both cBPF and eBPF programs,
the kernel statically analyzes the programs before loading them,
in order to ensure that they cannot harm the running system.
<P>

eBPF extends cBPF in multiple ways, including the ability to call
a fixed set of in-kernel helper functions

(via the
<B>BPF_CALL</B>

opcode extension provided by eBPF)
and access shared data structures such as eBPF maps.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Extended BPF Design/Architecture</H3>

eBPF maps are a generic data structure for storage of different data types.
Data types are generally treated as binary blobs, so a user just specifies
the size of the key and the size of the value at map-creation time.
In other words, a key/value for a given map can have an arbitrary structure.
<P>
A user process can create multiple maps (with key/value-pairs being
opaque bytes of data) and access them via file descriptors.
Different eBPF programs can access the same maps in parallel.
It's up to the user process and eBPF program to decide what they store
inside maps.
<P>
There's one special map type, called a program array.
This type of map stores file descriptors referring to other eBPF programs.
When a lookup in the map is performed, the program flow is
redirected in-place to the beginning of another eBPF program and does not
return back to the calling program.
The level of nesting has a fixed limit of 32,

so that infinite loops cannot be crafted.
At runtime, the program file descriptors stored in the map can be modified,
so program functionality can be altered based on specific requirements.
All programs referred to in a program-array map must
have been previously loaded into the kernel via
<B>bpf</B>().

If a map lookup fails, the current program continues its execution.
See
<B>BPF_MAP_TYPE_PROG_ARRAY</B>

below for further details.
<P>

Generally, eBPF programs are loaded by the user process and automatically
unloaded when the process exits.
In some cases, for example,
<B><A HREF="../man8/tc-bpf.8.html">tc-bpf</A></B>(8),

the program will continue to stay alive inside the kernel even after the
process that loaded the program exits.
In that case,
the tc subsystem holds a reference to the eBPF program after the
file descriptor has been closed by the user-space program.
Thus, whether a specific program continues to live inside the kernel
depends on how it is further attached to a given kernel subsystem
after it was loaded via
<B>bpf</B>().

<P>
Each eBPF program is a set of instructions that is safe to run until
its completion.
An in-kernel verifier statically determines that the eBPF program
terminates and is safe to execute.
During verification, the kernel increments reference counts for each of
the maps that the eBPF program uses,
so that the attached maps can't be removed until the program is unloaded.
<P>
eBPF programs can be attached to different events.
These events can be the arrival of network packets, tracing
events, classification events by network queueing  disciplines
(for eBPF programs attached to a
<B><A HREF="../man8/tc.8.html">tc</A></B>(8)

classifier), and other types that may be added in the future.
A new event triggers execution of the eBPF program, which
may store information about the event in eBPF maps.
Beyond storing data, eBPF programs may call a fixed set of
in-kernel helper functions.
<P>
The same eBPF program can be attached to multiple events and different
eBPF programs can access the same map:

<H3>Arguments</H3>

The operation to be performed by the
<B>bpf</B>()

system call is determined by the
<I>cmd</I>

argument.
Each operation takes an accompanying argument,
provided via
<I>attr</I>,

which is a pointer to a union of type
<I>bpf_attr</I>

(see below).
The
<I>size</I>

argument is the size of the union pointed to by
<I>attr</I>.

<P>
The value provided in
<I>cmd</I>

is one of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>BPF_MAP_CREATE</B>

<DD>
Create a map and return a file descriptor that refers to the map.
The close-on-exec file descriptor flag (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2))

is automatically enabled for the new file descriptor.
<DT><B>BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM</B>

<DD>
Look up an element by key in a specified map and return its value.
<DT><B>BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM</B>

<DD>
Create or update an element (key/value pair) in a specified map.
<DT><B>BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM</B>

<DD>
Look up and delete an element by key in a specified map.
<DT><B>BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY</B>

<DD>
Look up an element by key in a specified map and return the key
of the next element.
<DT><B>BPF_PROG_LOAD</B>

<DD>
Verify and load an eBPF program,
returning a new file descriptor associated with the program.
The close-on-exec file descriptor flag (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2))

is automatically enabled for the new file descriptor.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>bpf_attr</I>

union consists of various anonymous structures that are used by different
<B>bpf</B>()

commands:
<P>

<PRE>
union bpf_attr {
    struct {    /* Used by BPF_MAP_CREATE */
        __u32         map_type;
        __u32         key_size;    /* size of key in bytes */

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>eBPF maps</H3>

Maps are a generic data structure for storage of different types of data.
They allow sharing of data between eBPF kernel programs,
and also between kernel and user-space applications.
<P>
Each map type has the following attributes:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
type
<DT>*<DD>
maximum number of elements
<DT>*<DD>
key size in bytes
<DT>*<DD>
value size in bytes

</DL>
<P>

The following wrapper functions demonstrate how various
<B>bpf</B>()

commands can be used to access the maps.
The functions use the
<I>cmd</I>

argument to invoke different operations.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>BPF_MAP_CREATE</B>

<DD>
The
<B>BPF_MAP_CREATE</B>

command creates a new map,
returning a new file descriptor that refers to the map.
<P>

<PRE>
int
bpf_create_map(enum bpf_map_type map_type,
               unsigned int key_size,
               unsigned int value_size,
               unsigned int max_entries)
{
    union bpf_attr attr = {
        .map_type    = map_type,
        .key_size    = key_size,
        .value_size  = value_size,
        .max_entries = max_entries
    };

    return bpf(BPF_MAP_CREATE, &amp;attr, sizeof(attr));
}
</PRE>


<P>
The new map has the type specified by
<I>map_type</I>,

and attributes as specified in
<I>key_size</I>,

<I>value_size</I>,

and
<I>max_entries</I>.

On success, this operation returns a file descriptor.
On error, -1 is returned and
<I>errno</I>

is set to
<B>EINVAL</B>,

<B>EPERM</B>,

or
<B>ENOMEM</B>.

<P>
The
<I>key_size</I>

and
<I>value_size</I>

attributes will be used by the verifier during program loading
to check that the program is calling
<B>bpf_map_*_elem</B>()

helper functions with a correctly initialized
<I>key</I>

and to check that the program doesn't access the map element
<I>value</I>

beyond the specified
<I>value_size</I>.

For example, when a map is created with a
<I>key_size</I>

of 8 and the eBPF program calls
<P>

<PRE>
bpf_map_lookup_elem(map_fd, fp - 4)
</PRE>


<P>
the program will be rejected,
since the in-kernel helper function
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bpf_map_lookup_elem(map_fd,&nbsp;void&nbsp;*key)
<P>
expects to read 8 bytes from the location pointed to by
<I>key</I>,

but the
<I>fp&nbsp;-&nbsp;4</I>

(where
<I>fp</I>

is the top of the stack)
starting address will cause out-of-bounds stack access.
<P>
Similarly, when a map is created with a
<I>value_size</I>

of 1 and the eBPF program contains
<P>

<PRE>
value = bpf_map_lookup_elem(...);
*(u32 *) value = 1;
</PRE>


<P>
the program will be rejected, since it accesses the
<I>value</I>

pointer beyond the specified 1 byte
<I>value_size</I>

limit.
<P>
Currently, the following values are supported for
<I>map_type</I>:

<P>

<PRE>
enum bpf_map_type {
    BPF_MAP_TYPE_UNSPEC,  /* Reserve 0 as invalid map type */
    BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH,
    BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY,
    BPF_MAP_TYPE_PROG_ARRAY,
};
</PRE>


<P>
<I>map_type</I>

selects one of the available map implementations in the kernel.


For all map types,
eBPF programs access maps with the same
<B>bpf_map_lookup_elem</B>()

and
<B>bpf_map_update_elem</B>()

helper functions.
Further details of the various map types are given below.
<DT><B>BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM</B>

<DD>
The
<B>BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM</B>

command looks up an element with a given
<I>key</I>

in the map referred to by the file descriptor
<I>fd</I>.

<P>

<PRE>
int
bpf_lookup_elem(int fd, const void *key, void *value)
{
    union bpf_attr attr = {
        .map_fd = fd,
        .key    = ptr_to_u64(key),
        .value  = ptr_to_u64(value),
    };

    return bpf(BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM, &amp;attr, sizeof(attr));
}
</PRE>


<P>
If an element is found,
the operation returns zero and stores the element's value into
<I>value</I>,

which must point to a buffer of
<I>value_size</I>

bytes.
<P>
If no element is found, the operation returns -1 and sets
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>ENOENT</B>.

<DT><B>BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM</B>

<DD>
The
<B>BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM</B>

command
creates or updates an element with a given
<I>key/value</I>

in the map referred to by the file descriptor
<I>fd</I>.

<P>

<PRE>
int
bpf_update_elem(int fd, const void *key, const void *value,
                uint64_t flags)
{
    union bpf_attr attr = {
        .map_fd = fd,
        .key    = ptr_to_u64(key),
        .value  = ptr_to_u64(value),
        .flags  = flags,
    };

    return bpf(BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM, &amp;attr, sizeof(attr));
}
</PRE>


<P>
The
<I>flags</I>

argument should be specified as one of the following:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>BPF_ANY</B>

<DD>
Create a new element or update an existing element.
<DT><B>BPF_NOEXIST</B>

<DD>
Create a new element only if it did not exist.
<DT><B>BPF_EXIST</B>

<DD>
Update an existing element.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
On success, the operation returns zero.
On error, -1 is returned and
<I>errno</I>

is set to
<B>EINVAL</B>,

<B>EPERM</B>,

<B>ENOMEM</B>,

or
<B>E2BIG</B>.

<B>E2BIG</B>

indicates that the number of elements in the map reached the
<I>max_entries</I>

limit specified at map creation time.
<B>EEXIST</B>

will be returned if
<I>flags</I>

specifies
<B>BPF_NOEXIST</B>

and the element with
<I>key</I>

already exists in the map.
<B>ENOENT</B>

will be returned if
<I>flags</I>

specifies
<B>BPF_EXIST</B>

and the element with
<I>key</I>

doesn't exist in the map.
<DT><B>BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM</B>

<DD>
The
<B>BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM</B>

command
deleted the element whose key is
<I>key</I>

from the map referred to by the file descriptor
<I>fd</I>.

<P>

<PRE>
int
bpf_delete_elem(int fd, const void *key)
{
    union bpf_attr attr = {
        .map_fd = fd,
        .key    = ptr_to_u64(key),
    };

    return bpf(BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM, &amp;attr, sizeof(attr));
}
</PRE>


<P>
On success, zero is returned.
If the element is not found, -1 is returned and
<I>errno</I>

is set to
<B>ENOENT</B>.

<DT><B>BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY</B>

<DD>
The
<B>BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY</B>

command looks up an element by
<I>key</I>

in the map referred to by the file descriptor
<I>fd</I>

and sets the
<I>next_key</I>

pointer to the key of the next element.
<P>
<PRE>
int
bpf_get_next_key(int fd, const void *key, void *next_key)
{
    union bpf_attr attr = {
        .map_fd   = fd,
        .key      = ptr_to_u64(key),
        .next_key = ptr_to_u64(next_key),
    };

    return bpf(BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY, &amp;attr, sizeof(attr));
}
</PRE>


<P>
If
<I>key</I>

is found, the operation returns zero and sets the
<I>next_key</I>

pointer to the key of the next element.
If
<I>key</I>

is not found, the operation returns zero and sets the
<I>next_key</I>

pointer to the key of the first element.
If
<I>key</I>

is the last element, -1 is returned and
<I>errno</I>

is set to
<B>ENOENT</B>.

Other possible
<I>errno</I>

values are
<B>ENOMEM</B>,

<B>EFAULT</B>,

<B>EPERM</B>,

and
<B>EINVAL</B>.

This method can be used to iterate over all elements in the map.
<DT><B>close(map_fd)</B>

<DD>
Delete the map referred to by the file descriptor
<I>map_fd</I>.

When the user-space program that created a map exits, all maps will
be deleted automatically (but see NOTES).

<H3>eBPF map types</H3>

The following map types are supported:

<DT><B>BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH</B>

<DD>

Hash-table maps have the following characteristics:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Maps are created and destroyed by user-space programs.
Both user-space and eBPF programs

replaces existing elements atomically.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
Hash-table maps are

<DT><B>BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY</B>

<DD>

Array maps have the following characteristics:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Optimized for fastest possible lookup.
In the future the verifier/JIT compiler
may recognize lookup() operations that employ a constant key
and optimize it into constant pointer.
It is possible to optimize a non-constant
key into direct pointer arithmetic as well, since pointers and
<I>value_size</I>

are constant for the life of the eBPF program.
In other words,
<B>array_map_lookup_elem</B>()

may be 'inlined' by the verifier/JIT compiler
while preserving concurrent access to this map from user space.
<DT>*<DD>
All array elements pre-allocated and zero initialized at init time
<DT>*<DD>
The key is an array index, and must be exactly four bytes.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>map_delete_elem</B>()

fails with the error
<B>EINVAL</B>,

since elements cannot be deleted.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>map_update_elem</B>()

replaces elements in a
<B>nonatomic</B>

fashion;
for atomic updates, a hash-table map should be used instead.
There is however one special case that can also be used with arrays:
the atomic built-in
<B>__sync_fetch_and_add()</B>

can be used on 32 and 64 bit atomic counters.
For example, it can be
applied on the whole value itself if it represents a single counter,
or in case of a structure containing multiple counters, it could be
used on individual counters.
This is quite often useful for aggregation and accounting of events.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
Among the uses for array maps are the following:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
As &quot;global&quot; eBPF variables: an array of 1 element whose key is (index) 0
and where the value is a collection of 'global' variables which
eBPF programs can use to keep state between events.
<DT>*<DD>
Aggregation of tracing events into a fixed set of buckets.
<DT>*<DD>
Accounting of networking events, for example, number of packets and packet
sizes.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>BPF_MAP_TYPE_PROG_ARRAY</B> (since Linux 4.2)

<DD>
A program array map is a special kind of array map whose map values
contain only file descriptors referring to other eBPF programs.
Thus, both the
<I>key_size</I>

and
<I>value_size</I>

must be exactly four bytes.
This map is used in conjunction with the
<B>bpf_tail_call</B>()

helper.
<P>
This means that an eBPF program with a program array map attached to it
can call from kernel side into
<P>

<PRE>
void bpf_tail_call(void *context, void *prog_map, unsigned int index);
</PRE>


<P>
and therefore replace its own program flow with the one from the program
at the given program array slot, if present.
This can be regarded as kind of a jump table to a different eBPF program.
The invoked program will then reuse the same stack.
When a jump into the new program has been performed,
it won't return to the old program anymore.
<P>
If no eBPF program is found at the given index of the program array
(because the map slot doesn't contain a valid program file descriptor,
the specified lookup index/key is out of bounds,
or the limit of 32

nested calls has been exceed),
execution continues with the current eBPF program.
This can be used as a fall-through for default cases.
<P>
A program array map is useful, for example, in tracing or networking, to
handle individual system calls or protocols in their own subprograms and
use their identifiers as an individual map index.
This approach may result in performance benefits,
and also makes it possible to overcome the maximum
instruction limit of a single eBPF program.
In dynamic environments,
a user-space daemon might atomically replace individual subprograms
at run-time with newer versions to alter overall program behavior,
for instance, if global policies change.

<P>
For further details of eBPF program types, see below.
<P>
The remaining fields of
<I>bpf_attr</I>

are set as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<I>insns</I>

is an array of
<I>struct bpf_insn</I>

instructions.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>insn_cnt</I>

is the number of instructions in the program referred to by
<I>insns</I>.

<DT>*<DD>
<I>license</I>

is a license string, which must be GPL compatible to call helper functions
marked
<I>gpl_only</I>.

(The licensing rules are the same as for kernel modules,
so that also dual licenses, such as &quot;Dual BSD/GPL&quot;, may be used.)
<DT>*<DD>
<I>log_buf</I>

is a pointer to a caller-allocated buffer in which the in-kernel
verifier can store the verification log.
This log is a multi-line string that can be checked by
the program author in order to understand how the verifier came to
the conclusion that the eBPF program is unsafe.
The format of the output can change at any time as the verifier evolves.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>log_size</I>

size of the buffer pointed to by
<I>log_bug</I>.

If the size of the buffer is not large enough to store all
verifier messages, -1 is returned and
<I>errno</I>

is set to
<B>ENOSPC</B>.

<DT>*<DD>
<I>log_level</I>

verbosity level of the verifier.
A value of zero means that the verifier will not provide a log;
in this case,
<I>log_buf</I>

must be a NULL pointer, and
<I>log_size</I>

must be zero.
</DL>
<P>

Applying
<B><A HREF="../man2/close.2.html">close</A></B>(2)

to the file descriptor returned by
<B>BPF_PROG_LOAD</B>

will unload the eBPF program (but see NOTES).
<P>
Maps are accessible from eBPF programs and are used to exchange data between
eBPF programs and between eBPF programs and user-space programs.
For example,
eBPF programs can process various events (like kprobe, packets) and
store their data into a map,
and user-space programs can then fetch data from the map.
Conversely, user-space programs can use a map as a configuration mechanism,
populating the map with values checked by the eBPF program,
which then modifies its behavior on the fly according to those values.


<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>eBPF program types</H3>

The eBPF program type
(<I>prog_type</I>)

determines the subset of kernel helper functions that the program
may call.
The program type also determines the program input (context)---the
format of
<I>struct bpf_context</I>

(which is the data blob passed into the eBPF program as the first argument).





<P>
For example, a tracing program does not have the exact same
subset of helper functions as a socket filter program
(though they may have some helpers in common).
Similarly,
the input (context) for a tracing program is a set of register values,
while for a socket filter it is a network packet.
<P>
The set of functions available to eBPF programs of a given type may increase
in the future.
<P>
The following program types are supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER</B> (since Linux 3.19)

<DD>
Currently, the set of functions for
<B>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER</B>

is:
<P>

<PRE>
bpf_map_lookup_elem(map_fd, void *key)
                    /* look up key in a map_fd */
bpf_map_update_elem(map_fd, void *key, void *value)
                    /* update key/value */
bpf_map_delete_elem(map_fd, void *key)
                    /* delete key in a map_fd */
</PRE>


<P>
The
<I>bpf_context</I>

argument is a pointer to a
<I>struct __sk_buff</I>.









<DT><B>BPF_PROG_TYPE_KPROBE</B> (since Linux 4.1)

<DD>

[To be documented]





<DT><B>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SCHED_CLS</B> (since Linux 4.1)

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Events</H3>

Once a program is loaded, it can be attached to an event.
Various kernel subsystems have different ways to do so.
<P>
Since Linux 3.19,

the following call will attach the program
<I>prog_fd</I>

to the socket
<I>sockfd</I>,

which was created by an earlier call to
<B><A HREF="../man2/socket.2.html">socket</A></B>(2):

<P>

<PRE>
setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_BPF,
           &amp;prog_fd, sizeof(prog_fd));
</PRE>


<P>
Since Linux 4.1,

the following call may be used to attach
the eBPF program referred to by the file descriptor
<I>prog_fd</I>

to a perf event file descriptor,
<I>event_fd</I>,

that was created by a previous call to
<B><A HREF="../man2/perf_event_open.2.html">perf_event_open</A></B>(2):

<P>

<PRE>
ioctl(event_fd, PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_BPF, prog_fd);

<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

The
<B>bpf</B>()

system call is Linux-specific.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

In the current implementation, all
<B>bpf</B>()

commands require the caller to have the
<B>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</B>

capability.
<P>
eBPF objects (maps and programs) can be shared between processes.
For example, after
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2),

the child inherits file descriptors referring to the same eBPF objects.
In addition, file descriptors referring to eBPF objects can be
transferred over UNIX domain sockets.
File descriptors referring to eBPF objects can be duplicated
in the usual way, using
<B><A HREF="../man2/dup.2.html">dup</A></B>(2)

and similar calls.
An eBPF object is deallocated only after all file descriptors
referring to the object have been closed.
<P>
eBPF programs can be written in a restricted C that is compiled (using the
<B>clang</B>

compiler) into eBPF bytecode.
Various features are omitted from this restricted C, such as loops,
global variables, variadic functions, floating-point numbers,
and passing structures as function arguments.
Some examples can be found in the
<I>samples/bpf/*_kern.c</I>

files in the kernel source tree.


<P>
The kernel contains a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that translates
eBPF bytecode into native machine code for better performance.
The JIT compiler is disabled by default,
but its operation can be controlled by writing one of the
following integer strings to the file
<I>/proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable</I>:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>0<DD>
Disable JIT compilation (default).
<DT>1<DD>
Normal compilation.
<DT>2<DD>
Debugging mode.
The generated opcodes are dumped in hexadecimal into the kernel log.
These opcodes can then be disassembled using the program
<I>tools/net/bpf_jit_disasm.c</I>

provided in the kernel source tree.
</DL>
<P>

JIT compiler for eBPF is currently available for the x86-64, arm64,
and s390 architectures.
