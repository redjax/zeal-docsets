<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

If a filesystem supports files sharing physical storage between multiple
files, this
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</A></B>(2)

operation can be used to make some of the data in the
<B>src_fd</B>

file appear in the
<B>dest_fd</B>

file by sharing the underlying storage if the file data is identical
(&quot;deduplication&quot;).
Both files must reside within the same filesystem.
This reduces storage consumption by allowing the filesystem
to store one shared copy of the data.
If a file write should occur to a shared
region, the filesystem must ensure that the changes remain private to the file
being written.
This behavior is commonly referred to as &quot;copy on write&quot;.
<P>
This ioctl performs the &quot;compare and share if identical&quot; operation on up to
<I>src_length</I>

bytes from file descriptor
<I>src_fd</I>

at offset
<I>src_offset</I>.

This information is conveyed in a structure of the following form:

<PRE>

struct file_dedupe_range {
    __u64 src_offset;
    __u64 src_length;
    __u16 dest_count;
    __u16 reserved1;
    __u32 reserved2;
    struct file_dedupe_range_info info[0];
};
</PRE>


Deduplication is atomic with regards to concurrent writes, so no locks need to
be taken to obtain a consistent deduplicated copy.
<P>
The fields
<I>reserved1</I> and <I>reserved2</I>

must be zero.
<P>
Destinations for the deduplication operation are conveyed in the array at the
end of the structure.
The number of destinations is given in
<I>dest_count</I>,

and the destination information is conveyed in the following form:
<P>

<PRE>
struct file_dedupe_range_info {
        __s64 dest_fd;
        __u64 dest_offset;
        __u64 bytes_deduped;
        __s32 status;
        __u32 reserved;
};

</PRE>


<P>
Each deduplication operation targets
<I>src_length</I>

bytes in file descriptor
<I>dest_fd</I>

at offset
<I>dest_offset</I>.

The field
<I>reserved</I>

must be zero.
During the call,
<I>src_fd</I>

must be open for reading and
<I>dest_fd</I>

must be open for writing.
The combined size of the struct
<I>file_dedupe_range</I>

and the struct
<I>file_dedupe_range_info</I>

array must not exceed the system page size.
The maximum size of
<I>src_length</I>

is filesystem dependent and is typically 16MiB.
This limit will be enforced silently by the filesystem.
By convention, the storage used by
<I>src_fd</I>

is mapped into
<I>dest_fd</I>

and the previous contents in
<I>dest_fd</I>

are freed.
<P>
Upon successful completion of this ioctl, the number of bytes successfully
deduplicated is returned in
<I>bytes_deduped</I>

and a status code for the deduplication operation is returned in
<I>status</I>.

If even a single byte in the range does not match, the deduplication
request will be ignored and
<I>status</I>

set to
<B>FILE_DEDUPE_RANGE_DIFFERS</B>.

The
<I>status</I>

code is set to
<B>FILE_DEDUPE_RANGE_SAME</B>

for success, a negative error code in case of error, or
<B>FILE_DEDUPE_RANGE_DIFFERS</B>

if the data did not match.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set to indicate the error.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
The kernel was unable to allocate sufficient memory to perform the
operation or
<I>dest_count</I>

is so large that the input argument description spans more than a single
page of memory.
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
<I>src_fd</I>

is not open for reading;
<I>dest_fd</I>

is not open for writing or is open for append-only writes; or the filesystem
which
<I>src_fd</I>

resides on does not support deduplication.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The filesystem does not support deduplicating the ranges of the given files.
This error can also appear if either file descriptor represents
a device, FIFO, or socket.
Disk filesystems generally require the offset and length arguments
to be aligned to the fundamental block size.
Neither Btrfs nor XFS support
overlapping deduplication ranges in the same file.
<DT><B>EISDIR</B>

<DD>
One of the files is a directory and the filesystem does not support shared
regions in directories.
<DT><B>EOPNOTSUPP</B>

<DD>
This can appear if the filesystem does not support deduplicating either file
descriptor, or if either file descriptor refers to special inodes.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
<I>dest_fd</I>

is immutable.
<DT><B>ETXTBSY</B>

<DD>
One of the files is a swap file.
Swap files cannot share storage.
<DT><B>EXDEV</B>

<DD>
<I>dest_fd</I> and <I>src_fd</I>

are not on the same mounted filesystem.

<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

This ioctl operation first appeared in Linux 4.5.
It was previously known as
<B>BTRFS_IOC_FILE_EXTENT_SAME</B>

and was private to Btrfs.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

This API is Linux-specific.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Because a copy-on-write operation requires the allocation of new storage, the
<B><A HREF="../man2/fallocate.2.html">fallocate</A></B>(2)

operation may unshare shared blocks to guarantee that subsequent writes will
not fail because of lack of disk space.
<P>
Some filesystems may limit the amount of data that can be deduplicated in a
single call.
