  It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a
  hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil
  Galactic Empire. During the battle, <mark>Rebel spies managed
  to steal secret plans</mark> to the Empireâ€™s ultimate weapon,
  the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to
  destroy an entire planet.
